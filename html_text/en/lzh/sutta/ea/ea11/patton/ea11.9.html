  <h1>Devadatta</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Kalandaka Bamboo Park of Rājagṛha. He was accompanied by a large assembly of five hundred monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “How is it, monks? Does anyone see Devadatta’s teaching as clean? Still, Devadatta’s evil is quite grave, and he’ll get a punishment for an eon, which cannot be cured. I do not see a thread’s breadth of goodness in my Dharma that someone could describe of him. Because of this, I now say that the source of Devadatta’s punishment cannot be cured.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“He’s like a man who fell into a deep latrine. His whole body was submerged in it, and nowhere is he clean. Someone comes along to save his life and put him somewhere clean. Looking all around the sides of the latrine and that man, would they see a clean place? <span class='add'>[The man asks,]</span> ‘I’d like to grab something and pull myself out.’ But after looking over that place where nothing is clean for something the man could grab, they would give up and leave.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Thus, monks, do I regard that fool Devadatta. I do not see a thread’s breadth of goodness that someone could describe of him. He’ll get a punishment for an eon that cannot be cured. Why is that? Devadatta was focused on foolishness. Inclined to being attached to profit, he committed the five terrible sins, and he was born in a bad destiny when his body broke up and his life ended. Thus, monks, profit is a grave thing that causes people not to find the place of safety.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, monks, thoughts of profit that have arisen must be abandoned. If they have yet to arise, then don’t create anymore thoughts obsessed with it. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
