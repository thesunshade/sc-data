<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone were to cease one thing, I’d bear witness that they’ve become a non-returner. What is that one thing? It’s anger. Monks, you should cease anger, then I’ll bear witness that you’ve become non-returners.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha then spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The stain of anger<br>
Makes sentient beings fall to bad destinies.<br>
One should endeavor to abandon anger,<br>
Then they’ll become a non-returner.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
