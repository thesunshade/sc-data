<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “From the start, I do not see in this assembly a single thing that’s easily controlled and which brings a good result when its easily controlled. That thing is the heart.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“<span class='add'>[Therefore,]</span> monks, one should discern their heart and be well aware of its good roots. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
