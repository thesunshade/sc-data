<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “From the start, I don’t see in this assembly a single thing that’s uncontrollable and which is sure to bring a result of suffering when its difficult to control. That thing is the heart. Monks, this heart is uncontrollable. When its difficult to gain control of it, it surely brings a result of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, one should discern their heart. They should pay attention to their heart and be well aware of its roots of goodness. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
