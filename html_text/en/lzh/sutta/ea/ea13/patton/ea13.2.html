  <h1>Enjoyment of Desires</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Should you cease one thing, I’ll bear witness that you’ve achieved the fruit of spiritual knowledge and the end of the contaminants. What is that one thing? It’s enjoyment of desires. Therefore, monks, should you cease the enjoyment of desires, I’ll bear witness that you’ve achieved the fruit of spiritual knowledge and the end of the contaminants.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sentient beings attached to enjoyments<br>
Fall to bad destinations when they die.<br>
If you should abandon these desires now,<br>
You’ll achieve the fruit of the arhats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, you must always abandon notions that are attached to enjoyment <span class='add'>[of desires]</span>. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
