  <h1>Spitefulness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see a single thing here that so quickly wears something away as spitefulness does the religious life. Therefore, monks, you should cultivate kindness and acceptance. Be kind in your physical conduct, kind in your verbal conduct, and kind in your mental conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When the monks who heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
