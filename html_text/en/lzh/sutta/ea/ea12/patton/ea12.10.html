<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone taking profit is a serious thing, not an easy thing, for it prevents a person from reaching the unconditioned abode. Why is that? If that monk Śrīla hadn’t craved profit, it wouldn’t have occurred to him to kill measureless beings. He was born in Hell after his body broke up and his life ended.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Taking profit is a serious thing;<br>
It can ruin a person’s clean conduct.<br>
Therefore, you must discipline your thinking;<br>
Don’t take delight in that greedy longing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Because he attained samādhi, Śrīla<br>
Ascended up to Lord Śakra’s palace.<br>
He regressed from that spiritual knowledge<br>
And then fell back down to a slaughterhouse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, you should know from this that taking profit is a serious thing, not an easy thing. Control and prevent thoughts about profit before they arise. If they’ve already arisen, work to make them cease. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
