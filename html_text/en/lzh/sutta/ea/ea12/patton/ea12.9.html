<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Someone taking profit is a serious thing, not an easy thing, for it prevents a person from reaching the unconditioned abode. Why is that? The reward of profit cuts into a person’s skin. Cutting through skin, it cuts into their flesh. Cutting into their flesh, it cuts into their bones. Cutting into bone, it cuts into their marrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, in this way, you should know that profit is a very serious thing. If thoughts of profit have yet to arise, then don’t produce them. If they’ve already arisen, then work to stop them. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
