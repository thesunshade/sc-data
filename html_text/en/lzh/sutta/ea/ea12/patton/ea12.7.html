<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Profit is a very serious thing that prevents people from attaining the supreme and correct awakening. Why is that?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, that fool Devadattva took Prince *Pararuci’s offering of five hundred kettles of food. If he hadn’t given it to him, that fool Devadattva would have never done any evil. But the day came when Prince *Pararuci gave him five hundred kettles of food, and then Devadatta committed the five terrible sins. When his life ended, he was born in the Great Avici Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“From this, you should know that profit is a very serious thing that prevents people from attaining the supreme and correct awakening. <span class='add'>[Therefore, monks,]</span> you shouldn’t think of profit if such thoughts have yet to arise, and you should cease such thoughts if they do arise. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
