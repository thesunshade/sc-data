<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s one person who appears in the world who’s unmatched by others, who can’t be imitated, who walks alone without a companion, and who has no peer. None among gods and humans can compare to him, nor does their belief, precepts, learning, generosity, or wisdom compare to his. Who is that one person? He’s called be the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One. He is known as the one person who appears in the world who’s unmatched by others, who can’t be imitated, who walks alone without a companion, and who has no peer. None among gods and humans can compare to him, for his belief, precepts, learning, generosity, and wisdom are all complete.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, you should pay respect to the Buddha. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
