  <h1>The Single-Entry Path</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one person appears in the world, the single-entry path arises in the world. … the two truths … the three gateways to liberation … the true teaching of four truths … the five faculties … the cessation of six wrong views … the seven factors of awakening … the eightfold noble path … the nine abodes of sentient beings … the ten powers of the Tathāgata … the eleven liberations of kindness arise in the world. Who is that one person? He is called the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One. He is known as the one person who appears in the world, and then the single-entry path arises in the world. … the two truths … the three gateways to liberation … the true teaching of four truths … the five faculties … the cessation of six wrong views … the seven factors of awakening … the eightfold noble path … the nine abodes of sentient beings … the ten powers of the Tathāgata … the eleven liberations of kindness arise in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, always pay respect to the Tathāgata. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
