<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When one person appears in the world, gods and humans all flourish during that time, and the sentient beings in the three bad destinies dwindle in number. It’s just as when a noble <span class='add'>[wheel-turning]</span> king rules the world. The people in his capitol flourish, and neighboring countries weaken. This is likewise. When the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Correctly and Perfectly Awakened One appears in the world, <span class='add'>[gods and humans all flourish, and]</span> the sentient beings in the three evil destinies dwindle in number.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, you should believe in the Buddha. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
