<h3>The Origin of the Āgamas</h3>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Devotion to Śākyamuni, the seventh sage,<br>
Who explained the noble, unsurpassed law.<br>
After so long in the river of birth and death,<br>
The Bhagavān has made a crossing for us all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The venerable Kāśyapa, the noble assembly,<br>
And sagely Ānanda measureless in learning<br>
Provided relics from the Sugata’s parinirvāṇa,<br>
To countries from Kuśinagara to Magadha.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Upright Kāśyapa practiced the four immeasurables.<br>
“It’s for these sentient beings mired in the five destinies<br>
That past and present Awakened Ones explain the path.”<br>
Remembering the sage’s skillful teaching, he wept in grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Kāśyapa contemplated the correct Dharma’s source.<br>
“How will it spread and endure in the world?<br>
The Supreme Sage proclaimed various teachings,<br>
And we carry them memorized without any loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Who has the ability to collect the myriad teachings<br>
And the history of where they all took place?<br>
There is a wise man in this assembly:<br>
Ānanda is sagely, measureless in learning!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Then, he struck the bell to summon the four assemblies<br>
And the numberless assembly of monks.<br>
They had all attained the arhat’s liberation<br>
And become fields of merit freed from bondage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Because Kāśyapa pitied the world,<br>
He thought about past rewards of the Sage’s favor.<br>
“The Bhagavān entrusted the teaching with Ānanda,<br>
Hoping the Dharma would spread and endure in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“How do we pass it down without losing the lineage?<br>
He collected this Dharma treasure for three <em>asaṃkhya</em> eons.<br>
After that, he let the four assemblies hear the Dharma,<br>
And they were freed from all manner of pain after hearing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“I can’t express myself like Ānanda does,<br>
And the teachings are profound and diverse.<br>
How could I discern the Tathāgata’s instructions,<br>
The Buddha Dharma’s virtues, or his measureless wisdom?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Now, Venerable Kāśyapa was capable of being<br>
The great hero who entrusted the Dharma with the elders.<br>
For the Saṅgha at the time, Mahākāśyapa<br>
Was the Tathāgata in the world; they requested half seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Kāśyapa responded, “Though this may be so,<br>
I’m declining in old age, and I’m forgetful.<br>
Your task now is to memorize wisdom;<br>
Ensure that the Dharma endures in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Now, I possess the three pure eyes;<br>
I can access the knowledge of others’ minds.<br>
Of all the various kinds of sentient beings,<br>
None can surpass Venerable Ānanda.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Gods below the Brahma Heavens, Lord Śakra,<br>
The four world guardian kings, and others,<br>
Quickly met with Maitreya in the Tuṣita Heaven;<br>
The bodhisattvas were innumerable millions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Maitreya, Lord Śakra, and the four kings<br>
All put their palms together and said,<br>
“For all the teachings approved by the Buddha,<br>
Ānanda is the vessel of this Dharma of ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If someone doesn’t want the Dharma to survive,<br>
They’ll be the ruin of the Tathāgata’s teaching.<br>
Let it survive as a promise for sentient beings<br>
To be saved from their troubles and many problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><br>
“The Śakyan Teacher appeared briefly in the world;<br>
Though his flesh body is gone, the Dharma body remains.<br>
We must ensure that the Dharma root isn’t cut;<br>
Ānanda, don’t be confused when you recite the Dharma!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>When the honored Kāśyapa, noble assembly,<br>
Maitreya, Lord Śakra, and the four kings<br>
Kindly entreated Ānanda, they said,<br>
“Ensure that the Tathāgata’s teaching doesn’t perish!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Gentle Ānanda possessed the four immeasurables;<br>
His mind turned into a fine lion’s roar.<br>
He surveyed the four assemblies and looked at the sky;<br>
Tears fell as he wept uncontrollably.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>This prompted the light of his gentle countenance<br>
To shine on sentient beings everywhere like dawn.<br>
Maitreya gazed at the light; Śakra and Brahmā<br>
Waited unmoved to hear the unsurpassed Dharma.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The four assemblies were quiet and focused,<br>
Wanting to hear the Dharma with minds undistracted.<br>
Venerable Kāsyapa and the noble Saṅgha<br>
Looked straight ahead with eyes unblinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Ānanda then recited sūtras without measure.<br>
“Who could supply them all as one collection?<br>
Now, I will make them into three divisions<br>
And compose a verse for every ten sūtras.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The sūtras make one part, the Vinaya the second,<br>
And Abhidharma scriptures make the third.<br>
Past Sambuddhas had these three divisions;<br>
Sūtra, Vinaya, and Abhidharma make the Tripiṭaka.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Now, I’ll divide the sūtras into four sections.<br>
<em>Ekottarika</em> is first, <em>Madhyama</em> second,<br>
Third is the <em>Dīrgha</em> with its many ornaments,<br>
And the <em>Saṃyukta</em> is the last and fourth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Venerable Ānanda then thought,<br>
“The Tathāgata’s Dharma body doesn’t decay.<br>
Enduring in the world, forever and unending,<br>
Gods and people hear it and achieve the path’s fruit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sometimes one item has a deep meaning;<br>
Hard to retain and recite, it can’t be remembered.<br>
Now, I’ll collect those one-item meanings,<br>
Put them one after another, so they won’t be lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“There are pairs that restart after two items, too,<br>
Sets of three that are like strings of jewels,<br>
Sets of fours that stop at four items as well,<br>
Sets of five, then sixes, and sevens after that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sets of eight meanings continue to nines;<br>
Sets of ten and then the elevens after them.<br>
The Dharma Jewel thus won’t be forgotten;<br>
It’ll endure in the world forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>To compile these teachings in the great assembly,<br>
Ānanda then ascended to the high seat.<br>
Maitreya said admiringly, “What joyous speech<br>
That collates together teachings and meanings!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“These teachings are divided into fitting parts,<br>
Each taught by the Bhagavān in a different way.<br>
Bodhisattvas resolved on the Great Vehicle<br>
Were taught these various distinctions, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Sage taught them six <em>pāramitā</em>s:<br>
Generosity, precepts, tolerance, effort,<br>
<em>Dhyāna</em>, and wisdom powers like the new moon.<br>
With these <em>pāramitā</em>s, they examine the teachings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Some have courage to give away their eyes,<br>
Their bodies, blood, and flesh, without regret;<br>
Their wives, countries, wealth, and children as well.<br>
This <em>pāramitā</em> of generosity is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The pāramitā of precepts is like diamond,<br>
Neither broken nor violated and flawless.<br>
Carrying the precepts in mind like a pot,<br>
This <em>pāramitā</em> of precepts is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If someone were to chop their hands and feet off,<br>
They aren’t angry and tolerate such violence.<br>
Being like the ocean, not increasing or decreasing,<br>
This <em>pāramitā</em> of tolerance is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“When they perform good and evil deeds of<br>
Body, speech, and mind, they’re all unsatisfying.<br>
Opposing practices that don’t reach awakening,<br>
This <em>pāramitā</em> of effort is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“There are meditators who breathe in and out<br>
With their minds stable and undistracted;<br>
Even an earthquake doesn’t disturb them.<br>
This <em>pāramitā</em> of <em>dhyāna</em> is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Counting atoms with the power of wisdom<br>
Or the number of eons unreckonable,<br>
They compose treatises with unconfused reasoning.<br>
This pāramitā of wisdom is not to be discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The teachings and profound texts about emptiness,<br>
Hard to discern and understand, can’t be contemplated.<br>
Future people will progress slowly and feel hesitant,<br>
So these bodhisattva virtues are not to be discarded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>As he arranged them, Ānanda then thought,<br>
“Fools don’t trust the bodhisattva practices.<br>
Only the arhats and those freed by faith<br>
Believe in them without reservation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The fourfold assembly who’d set out for awakening<br>
And all kinds of sentient beings who had,<br>
They had firm faith and didn’t hesitate<br>
As they collected these teachings into one part.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Maitreya said admiringly, “What joyous speech!<br>
To set out on the great vehicle is a vast intent.<br>
Sometimes, its teachings end the bonds;<br>
Sometimes, they achieve the path’s fruit.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Ānanda said, “What about this?<br>
I saw the Tathāgata expound these teachings,<br>
But others I didn’t hear from the Tathāgata.<br>
Won’t there be people who doubt those teachings?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Were I to say I saw these teachings when I didn’t,<br>
The future Saṅgha would be a falsehood.<br>
Now, I’ll state that the sūtras were thus heard<br>
When the Buddha was in some city or country.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“At Vārāṇasī, the first Dharma was taught,<br>
Then the three Kāśyapas were converted in Magadha.<br>
Next, he was in the land of the Śākya Lion,<br>
Campā, Kuru, and Vaiśālī.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Then, the palaces of gods, nāgas, and asuras,<br>
And the gandharvas, et al. at Kuśinagara.<br>
If the place a sūtra was taught is unknown,<br>
I’ll say its origin was in Śrāvastī.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“This was heard by me on one occasion:<br>
The Buddha was at Śrāvastī with the disciples.<br>
At Jeta’s Grove, they cultivated good deeds,<br>
In the park donated by wealthy Anāthapiṇḍada.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“While there, the Buddha addressed the monks:<br>
‘One should cultivate one thing; Focus their mind,<br>
And attend to one thing carefully.<br>
What is that one thing? Recollecting the Buddha.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Recollecting the Dharma, Saṅgha, and precepts,<br>
Recollecting generosity and the gods,<br>
Recollecting calmness, breathing, and body,<br>
And the unconfused recollection of death makes ten.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Another ten are called ten recollections, too.<br>
After that, I will praise the Sage’s disciples.<br>
The first was Kauṇḍinya, who was a true Buddha son,<br>
And the last was a lesser one named Subhadra.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Using this method throughout the sets of one,<br>
I’ll go from sets of two to sets of three.<br>
The sets of four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,<br>
And eleven will all be comprehensive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Inceasing one by one, all these teachings,<br>
Abundant in meaning and broad in wisdom, are unending.<br>
Each sūtra’s meaning is also deep,<br>
Therefore, it’s called the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Now, this incremental teaching is hard to comprehend,<br>
Hard to retain and realize, and isn’t clear.<br>
Monks praise their own virtuous deeds,<br>
But now we should praise the Sage who’s supreme.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“He was like a potter making a vessel,<br>
Fashioning it as he likes without hesitation.<br>
Thus, the Āgama that increases one by one<br>
And the three vehicles have no difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Buddha’s sūtras are subtle and extremely deep;<br>
They remove the bonds like a rushing river.<br>
Still, this <em>Ekottarika</em> is the highest,<br>
Clarifying three eyes and removing three defilements.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Those who focus on retaining the <em>Ekottarika</em>,<br>
They memorize the Tathāgata’s treasury.<br>
Even if they don’t end their bonds in this life,<br>
They’ll get the highest wisdom in a later one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If someone copies the scrolls of this scripture,<br>
Supporters who give them silk clothes, flowers, and parasols<br>
Will get merits that are measureless and inestimable<br>
Because this Dharma jewel is rare to encounter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>When he said this, there was an earthquake,<br>
Flowers and incense rained until they were knee-deep.<br>
The gods in the sky praised him: “Good!<br>
All of it is as the Highest Sage had taught.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sūtras are one <em>piṭaka</em>, Vinaya is a second <em>piṭaka</em>,<br>
And Abhidharma is a third <em>piṭaka</em>.<br>
The expansive Mahāyāna doctrine so profound<br>
And other sūtras make a mixed <em>piṭaka</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The Buddha’s words are a haven that never varies,<br>
Their circumstances from beginning to end agree.”<br>
Maitreya and the gods praised them: “Good!<br>
May the sūtras of Śākyamuni endure a long time!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Maitreya quickly rose with flowers in hand<br>
And joyously scattered them over Ānanda.<br>
“These sūtras are the true teachings of the Tathāgata.<br>
Let Ānanda quickly achieve the fruit of the path!”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> Contains All Buddha Teachings</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then, Venerable Ānanda and Brahmā led the Brahmakāyika gods as they assembled together. The Paranirmitavaśavartin gods led their followers as they assembled together. The Nirmāṇarati gods led their followers as they assembled together. The King of Tuṣita led a host of gods as they assembled together. Yama led his followers as they assembled together. Śakra the Lord of Gods led the host of the Thirty-Three Gods as they assembled together. God King Dhṛtarāṣṭra led the <em>gandharva</em>s as they assembled together. God King Virūḍhaka led the <em>kumbhāṇḍa</em>s as they assembled together. God King Virūpākṣa led a host of <em>nāga</em>s as they assembled together. God King Vaiśravaṇa led a host of <em>yakṣa</em>s and <em>rākṣasa</em>s as they assembled together.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The great worthy Maitreya then addressed the <em>bodhisattva</em>s of the fortunate eon, “I encourage all you clansmen and clanswomen to recite and retain the honored <em>Ekottarika</em> teaching! Widely disseminate it! Take it to gods and humans who’ll approve of it!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When he said this, the gods, worldly people, <em>gandharva</em>s, <em>asura</em>s, <em>garuḍa</em>s, <em>mahoraga</em>s, and <em>kiṃnara</em>s all said, “We will protect all these good men and good women who recite and retain the honored <em>Ekottarika</em> teaching and disseminate it widely so that it will never come to an end.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Venerable Ānanda then told Uttara, “Now, I entrust this <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> with you. Chant, recite, and read it well; don’t let it be corrupted or reduced. Why is that? Those who take this honored scripture lightly will fall back and behave like ordinary people. And why? Uttara, this <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> produces the teachings of the thirty-seven factors of the path and all the things that arise from them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then, Mahākāśyapa asked Ānanda, “Ānanda, how can the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> produce the teachings of the thirty-seven factors of the path and all the things that arise from them?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Ānanda replied, “So it is, so it is! Venerable Kāśyapa, the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> produces the thirty-seven factors and all the things that arise from them. The <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> contains a single verse that produces the thirty-seven factors and all the things <span class='add'>[that arise from them]</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Kāśyapa asked, “What verse produces the thirty-seven factors and all the things <span class='add'>[that arise from them]</span>?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Venerable Ānanda then recited the verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“‘Don’t do anything evil,<br>
And put what’s good into practice.<br>
To purify one’s own mind:<br>
This is the teaching of Buddhas.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Why is that? ‘Don’t do anything evil’ is the root of all teachings that produces all good things. The mind is purified by those good things it produces. Therefore, Kāśyapa, the physical, verbal, and mental conduct of Buddhas, the Bhagavāns, is always to cultivate purification.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Kāśyapa asked Ānanda, “Ānanda, how is it that only the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> produces the thirty-seven factors and all the things <span class='add'>[that arise from them]</span>? Don’t the rest of the four Āgamas produce them, too?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Ānanda replied, “Kāśyapa, it contains the meaning of the four Āgamas. The complete and perfect teaching of Buddhas is in this single verse, as well as the teachings of solitary buddhas and disciples. Why is that? ‘Don’t do anything evil’ is the rule of all the precepts. Clean conduct is to ‘put what’s good into practice.’ The purification of mind is ‘to purify one’s own mind.’ To remove what’s wrong and mistaken is ‘the teaching of the Buddhas.’ It departs from deluded ideas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“How can it be, Kāśyapa, that someone pure in precepts would have a mind that isn’t pure? When someone’s mind is pure, they aren’t mistaken. Their deluded ideas cease because they make no mistake. They then can achieve the fruit of the thirty-seven factors of the path. How could it not be with the teachings that they achieve the fruit of the path?”</p>
<h3>Why Uttara Was Entrusted with the <em>Ekottarika</em></h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>Kāśyapa asked, “Ānanda, why did you entrust the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> with Uttara? Didn’t you entrust all the teachings with the rest of the monks?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>Ānanda replied, “The <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> is all the teachings. The teachings and the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> are one, not two.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Kāśyapa asked, “But why did you entrust this <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> with Uttara and not the rest of the monks?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>Ānanda replied, “Kāśyapa, you should know that ninety-one eons ago Vipaśyin the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appeared in the world. This monk Uttara was named *Ekottara then. That Buddha entrusted this <em>Ekottarika</em> teaching to him, tasking him with chanting, reciting, and reading it. After that time thirty-one eons ago, the next Buddha was named Śikhin the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One. This monk Uttara was named *Mukhottara then. That Tathāgata Śikhin again entrusted this teaching to him, tasking him with chanting, reciting, and reading it. During that time thirty-one eons ago, Viśvabhū the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One also appeared in the world. This monk Uttara was named Nagottara then. He was again entrusted with this teaching and tasked with chanting, reciting, and reading it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Kāśyapa, you should know that during this fortunate eon there was Krakucchanda the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who appeared in the world. This monk Uttara was named *\Vidyūttara then. He was again entrusted with this teaching and tasked with chanting, reciting, and reading it. Next, another Buddha during this fortunate eon named Kanakamuni the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appeared in the world. This monk Uttara was named Devottara then. He was again entrusted with this teaching and tasked with chanting, reciting, and reading it. Another Buddha during this fortunate eon named Kāśyapa the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appeared in the world. This monk Uttara was named Brahmottara then. Again, he was entrusted with this teaching and tasked with chanting, reciting, and reading it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Kāśyapa, you should know that Śākyamuni is now the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who has appeared in the world, and this monk is now named Uttara. Although the Buddha Śākyamuni has <em>parinirvāṇa</em>-ed, the monk Ānanda is still in the world. The Bhagavān had entrusted me with all his teachings, and now I’ve also entrusted it with Uttara. Why is that? I examined him as a vessel and investigated his past. Afterward, I entrusted the teachings to him. And why?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“In the past during this fortunate eon, Krakucchanda the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One appeared in the world who was One Accomplished in Insight and Conduct, a Well Gone One, Understander of the World, an Unsurpassed Worthy, a Trainer in the Dharma Path, a Teacher to Gods and Humans, and called a Buddha and Bhagavān. At the time, there was a king name *Makhādeva who ruled according to the Dharma and was never crooked. He lived for a very long time, and his uprightness was peerless and rare in the world. For 84,000 years, he entertained himself as a youth. For 84,000 years, he governed according to the Dharma as a prince. For 84,000 years, he also ruled according to the Dharma as the king of the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Kāśyapa, you should know that once the Bhagavān had traveled to the Mango Park. After eating, he paced back and forth in the yard as usual with myself and an attendant. The Bhagavān then smiled and a rainbow issued from his mouth. When I saw that, I knelt and said to the Bhagavān, ‘The Buddha doesn’t smile for no reason. Please let me hear the beginning and end of it, for the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One never smiles for no reason.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Kāśyapa, the Buddha then told me, ‘Once in the past during this fortunate eon, a Tathāgata named Krakucchanda the Arhat and Completely Awakened One appeared in the world. It was right here that he taught the Dharma to his disciples in detail.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“‘Furthermore, during this fortunate eon, there was also Kanakamuni the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who appeared in the world. It was also right here that that Buddha taught the Dharma to his disciples in detail.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“‘Furthermore, during this fortunate eon, there was also Kāśyapa the Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who appeared in the world. It was also right here that that Tathāgata Kāśyapa taught the Dharma to his disciples in detail.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Kāśyapa, I knelt in front of the Buddha and said to him, ‘Please let it be right here as well that the Buddha Śākyamuni teaches the Dharma to his disciples in full.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“Kāśyapa, the Buddha Śākyamuni sat down there, and then he told me <span class='add'>[this story]</span>:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>The king then said to that man, “Take gold tweezers, pluck out my white hair, and put it in my hand.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>That man did as the king instructed. He took gold tweezers and plucked out the white hair in front of him. When the great king saw that white hair, he spoke this verse:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“Now, I’ve enjoyed the fortunes that are among humans, but I must apply myself to the virtues that ascend to Heaven. I’ll cut off my hair and beard, put on the three-piece Dharma robe, become steadfast in faith, leave home, and train on the path that parts with all manner of pain.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>King *Makhādeva then told his first prince, who was named *Dīrghāyu: “Did you know? White hair has grown on my head.

You will succeed to my throne and rule with the Dharma. Don’t let anything be forgotten, my instructions be contradicted, or anyone return to the behavior of ordinary people. Why is that? If people contradict my words, then they’ll behave like ordinary people. Ordinary people spend a long time on the three muddy roads dealing with the eight difficulties.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>Having entrusted his throne to the prince, King *Makhādeva also bestowed his treasure to his barber. From there, he cut off his hair and beard, put on the three-piece Dharma robe, made his faith steadfast, left home, and trained on the path that parts with all manner of pain. He cultivated the religious life well for 84,000 years and practiced four immeasurable mental states: Kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. When his body died and his life ended, he was born up in the Brahma Heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>King *Dīrghāyu remembered his father’s instructions and never abandoned them. He ruled with the Dharma without any crookedness. Before ten days had passed, he became the next noble wheel-turning king replete with the seven treasures. Those seven treasures were the wheel treasure, elephant treasure, horse treasure, jewel treasure, beautiful woman treasure, treasurer treasure, and army general treasure. These were the seven treasures. He also had a thousand sons who were courageous and wise. They eliminated all manner of pain in all four directions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a><em>Ruling with the former king’s Dharma as described above</em>, King *Dīrghāyu composed this verse:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>King *Dīrghāyu then told his first prince, who was named *Sudarśana: “Did you know? White hair has grown on my head.

That king then was Śākyamuni in the present. King *Dīrghāyu is Ānanda now. King *Sudarśana is the monk Uttara now. They always accepted the king’s Dharma, never abandoned it, and didn’t let it come to an end. King *Sudarśana renewed his father’s command to rule with the Dharma and not to end the king’s instructions. Why is that? So that it would be difficult to contradict his father’s teaching.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a>Venerable Ānanda then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Respecting the Dharma, presenting what’s honored,<br>
Not forgetting to repay past kindness,<br>
And venerating with the three deeds:<br>
These are things valued by the wise.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>“After contemplating the meaning of this, I entrusted the <em>Ekottarika Āgama</em> with the monk Uttara. Why was that? All the teachings arise from it.”</p>
<h3>Ānanda’s Exhortation</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a>Venerable Ānanda then told Uttara, “When you became a noble wheel-turning king before, you didn’t forget the king’s instructions. Now, you’ve been entrusted again with this Dharma. Don’t forget the correct teaching and don’t behave like ordinary people. Now, you should know that if anyone goes against the Tathāgata’s good teaching, they will fall back to the level of ordinary people. Why is that? At that time, King *Makhādeva hadn’t reached the final level of liberation. He had yet to attain that liberation and reach the place of safety. Although he got the rewards of the Brahma Heaven, he still didn’t reach the final good deeds of the Tathāgata, which is then called the final place of safety. For the happiness that’s infinite and honored by gods and humans, one must attain Nirvāṇa. Therefore, Uttara, you should accept and keep this Dharma. Chant, recite, and read it from memory, and don’t let it be lost.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>Ānanda then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Because the Dharma will be remembered,<br>
Tathāgatas will arise from it.<br>
The Dharma produces Completely Awakened Ones,<br>
As well as pratyeka buddhas and arhats.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Dharma eliminates all manner of pain<br>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Someone who wants to become a Buddha<br>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Sūtras, Abhidharma,<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>When Venerable Ānanda said this, Heaven and Earth shook in six ways. The honored spirits and gods in the sky took heavenly flowers in hand and scattered them over Venerable Ānanda and the fourfold assembly. All the gods, nāgas, yakṣa spirits, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, and mahoragas felt joyous and praised him: “Good, Venerable Ānanda! Good! In the beginning, middle, and end, none of your words aren’t good. They revere the Dharma as it should be, and they’re spoken sincerely. There’s nothing achieved by gods and worldly people that doesn’t come from the Dharma. Anyone who does evil will fall to Hell or be born among hungry ghosts and animals.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>Venerable Ānanda then roared the lion’s roar for the fourfold assembly, exhorting everyone to put this Dharma into practice. Then, 30,000 gods and humans attained the purification of their Dharma eyes, right there on their seats. The fourfold assembly, gods, and worldly people who heard what the Venerable had taught rejoiced and approved it.</p>
