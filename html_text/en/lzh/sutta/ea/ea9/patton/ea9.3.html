  <h1>The Mind</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see a single thing as quick as the mind. It cannot be grasped without using the method of the Dharma, and then the mind spins around quickly. Therefore, monks, ordinary people are unable to observe their mind thinking.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, one should control their thinking to lead their mind to the good path. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
