  <h1>The Mind (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see a single thing as quick as the mind. There’s no comparison for it. The mind drops one thing and picks up another when it isn’t focused and settled, just like a monkey. The mind is likewise when that previous and subsequent perceptions of its thoughts aren’t the same. Therefore, monks, ordinary people are unable to observe the origin of their mind’s thinking.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, one should control their thinking to lead their mind to the good path. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved of it.</p>
