<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When I continuously examine the things that a person thinks about in their mind, I see: ‘This person will be born up in Heaven in the time it takes to flex their arm.’ Why is that? It’s because of their good mind. Having given rise to a good mind, they’ll be born up in Heaven.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Suppose that a person<br>
Produces a good and wonderful mind.<br>
Now, I’ll tell you monks<br>
The meaning of this in detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Supposing their life were to end<br>
Right at this moment in time,<br>
They would be born up in Heaven<br>
Because of their mind’s good conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, one should purify their thinking and not produce defiled conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
