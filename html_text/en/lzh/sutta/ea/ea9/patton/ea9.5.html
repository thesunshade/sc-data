<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “When I continuously examine the things that a person thinks about in their mind, I see: ‘This person will fall to Hell in the time it takes to flex their arm.’ Why is that? Because of their evil thoughts, their mind becomes ill, and they fall down into Hell.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Suppose that a person<br>
Harbors hateful notions in their heart.<br>
Now, I’ll tell you monks<br>
The meaning of this in detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Supposing their life were to end<br>
Right at this moment in time,<br>
Then they would be sent to Hell<br>
Because of their mind’s defiled conduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, one should control their mind and not do defiled conduct. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
