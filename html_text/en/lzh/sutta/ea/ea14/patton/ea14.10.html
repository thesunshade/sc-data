<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There isn’t anything in this assembly greater than this one thing that when cultivated and cultivated often brings the merits that are among humans, merits up in Heaven, and attains the realization of Nirvāṇa.
