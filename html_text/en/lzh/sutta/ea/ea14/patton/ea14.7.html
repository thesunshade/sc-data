  <h1>False Speech</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see anything in this assembly like one thing that when cultivated and cultivated often accomplishes the actions of Hell, the actions of hungry ghosts, and the actions of animals. If they were born among humans, a person will have foul breath, and people will dislike them. What is that one thing? It’s false speech.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha told the monks, “If a person speaks falsely, uses flattery, and instigates conflicts between one group and another, they will fall into Hell, among the hungry ghosts, or among animals. Why is that? It’s because they spoke falsely.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, you should always train in being honest and not speak falsely. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
