  <h1>Killing Beings</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t see anything in this assembly like one thing that accomplishes the actions of Hell, actions of hungry ghosts, and actions of animals when cultivated and cultivated often. If they were born among humans, a person’s life will be made quite short by it. What is that one thing? It’s the killing of beings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha told the monks, “If a person likes killing beings, then they’ll fall into Hell, among hungry ghosts, or among animals. If they are born among humans, their life will be made quite short by it. Why is that? Because they ended the lives of others.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, you should always be merciful and not capable of killing beings. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
