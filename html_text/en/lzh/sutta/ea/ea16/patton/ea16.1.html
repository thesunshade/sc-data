  <h1>Nanda</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“<span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, Venerable Nanda was staying in Nāgapuṣpa Park near the city of Śrāvastī. While residing in a secluded place, Venerable Nanda had this thought: “It’s so difficult to meet a Tathāgata when he appears in the world. It takes a million eons for him to appear, during which time he truly cannot be seen. It’s just a very long night until he appears. It’s like the time it takes for the <em>udumbara</em> flower to appear. It’s so difficult to meet a Tathāgata when he appears in the world. It takes a million eons for him to appear, during which time he truly cannot be seen. And there are other things that are hard to encounter: All actions coming to a stop, the end of craving without remainder, the lack of defilement, and the complete cessation of <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Knowing this thought in Venerable Nanda’s mind, Māra acting as a god went to the Śakyan woman Sundarī. He hovered in the sky as he called to her in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Today is a day for you to rejoice,<br>
And put on the dress of the five pleasures!<br>
Nanda has discarded the Dharma robes;<br>
He’s coming to enjoy himself with you!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Śakyan woman Sundarī rejoiced and celebrated when she heard what that god said, and she was unable to control herself. She dressed herself up, decorated the rooms of her house, prepared fine seats, and danced to music, just as she had when Nanda lived at home.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then, King Prasenajit was attending a meeting in his discussion hall when he heard that the monk Nanda had renounced the Dharma robes and would return to working for his family. The reason for this was that a god in the sky had told this to Nanda’s wife.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>When he heard this said, King Presenajit felt aggrieved. He rode his white elephant to that park. Arriving there, he waded into Lake Nāgapuṣpa. Seeing him from afar, he walked up to Venerable Nanda, bowed his head at his feet, and then sat to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Venerable Nanda then asked Prasenajit, “Great King, why have you come here looking so affected? Is there some reason you have come here to me?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>King Prasenajit replied, “Venerable, you ought to know that while I was attending a meeting in my discussion hall, I heard that the Venerable had discarded the Dharma robes and returned to wearing white clothes. Having heard that, I came here because I was worried about the Venerable. What instruction might he have?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>With an easy smile, Nanda then told the King, “Why does the King say this without seeing or hearing it himself? Hasn’t the King heard it from the Tathāgata that I’ve removed the bonds, that for me birth and death is ended, that I’ve established the religious life, and that I’ve accomplished the task? That I truly know that I won’t return to a womb again? I’ve become an <em>arhat</em>, and now my mind is liberated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The King replied, “I haven’t heard from the Tathāgata that the monk Nanda … has ended birth and death … has become an <em>arhat</em>, and his mind is liberated. The reason I said this was that a god came to the Śakyan woman Sundarī and told it to her. When she heard about it, your wife Sundarī danced, played music, mended her clothes and ornaments, and prepared seats. When I heard about it, I came here to the Venerable.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Venerable Nanda told the King, “Why does the Great King say this without witnessing or hearing it himself? There aren’t any ascetics or priests who don’t enjoy the happiness of respite, the happiness of being well gone, the happiness of the ascetic, and the happiness of <em>nirvāṇa</em>. They don’t contemplate the firepit of lustful desire. It wouldn’t be the case that they would go back to that.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Bones are like a chain, and flesh is like a pile of stones. Like a sword coated in honey, greed brings a little profit, but the trouble later can’t be foreseen. Like a branch broken by an abundance of fruit, like a loan that must be repaid soon, like a jungle of sword trees, like poisonous herbs, or like bitter leaves, flowers, and fruit, lustful desire should be contemplated as being likewise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“It wouldn’t be the case that their minds would be addicted to that. If someone doesn’t contemplate that desire as a firepit … bitter fruit, but they want to cross the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance, they won’t be able to do it. If someone hasn’t crossed the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance, but they want to gain entry to the realm of remainderless <em>nirvāṇa</em>, to <em>parinirvāṇa</em>, they won’t be able to do it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Great King, you should know that this is surely the case for ascetics and priests who investigate the happiness of respite, the happiness of being well gone, the happiness of the ascetic, and the happiness of <em>nirvāṇa</em>. They understand from their investigations that the firepit of lustful desire is like a chain of bones, a pile of flesh, a sword coated in honey, a branch broken by an abundance of fruit, a loan that’s due, a sword tree, a poisonous tree, or a poisonous herb. They all investigate and comprehend that this is the case. Having fully understood it, they know what produces the fire of desire, and then they surely can cross the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance. They will surely have crossed the flood of desire, the flood of existence, the flood of views, and the flood of ignorance.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“How is it, Great King? What did you see and what did you know when you said that about me? Great King, I’ve now become an <em>arhat</em>. For me, birth and death has ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I won’t again experience a mother’s womb, and my mind has been liberated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>Feeling joy in his heart, a good thought arose in King Prasenajit, and he said to Venerable Nanda, “I have not even a hair’s breadth of doubt about it. Now that I know the Venerable has become an <em>arhat</em>, I must take my leave and return to the many affairs of state.”</p>
<p>Nanda replied, “You may go whenever it’s convenient.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>King Prasenajit rose from his seat, bowed at Nanda’s feet, and departed. A moment after he had left, the Māra King came to Venerable Nanda.  Hovering in the sky, he addressed Nanda in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Your wife’s face is shaped like the moon;<br>
She’s wearing gold and silver jewelry.<br>
Recall how her shape and her countenance<br>
Had always pleased you with the five pleasures.<br>
She sings while strumming lutes and playing drums;<br>
The sound of her voice is soft and gentle.<br>
She’d be able to dispel all sadness<br>
And spread happiness throughout this forest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>Venerable Nanda then thought, “This is Māra acting as a god.” Having realized this, he replied in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“I did have such thoughts as that in the past,<br>
And my debauchery was tireless back then.<br>
I was indeed tied up by my desires,<br>
Not noticing old age, illness, and death.<br>
Now, I’ve crossed over the flood of desire,<br>
Without defilement and stained by nothing.<br>
Honors and status are suffering, too;<br>
The only real happiness is in Dharma.<br>
Now, I don’t have any more of these bonds,<br>
Lust, hatred, and delusion are all gone.<br>
Those people who don’t train in this Dharma<br>
Should be recognized and known as foolish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>When he heard these words, Māra who was acting as a god felt aggrieved and disappeared from that place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>A group of monks related all these events to the Bhagavān. The Bhagavān told the monks, “There’s no monk who is more upright than that monk Nanda. In having an indifferent manner, it’s also the monk Nanda. In having no thoughts of desire, it’s also the monk Nanda. In having no anger, it’s also the monk Nanda. In having no delusions, it’s also the monk Nanda. In becoming an <em>arhat</em>, it’s also the monk Nanda. For this reason, the monk Nanda is upright and peaceful in his manner.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Among my disciples, the most upright is the monk Nanda. In having a peaceful manner, it’s also the monk Nanda who is best.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
