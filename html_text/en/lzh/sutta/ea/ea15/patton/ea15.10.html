  <h1>Right View</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two causes and two conditions that produce right view. What are the two? Accepting the Dharma teaching and inner thought that’s calming and contemplative. Monks, these are two causes and two conditions that produce right view. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
