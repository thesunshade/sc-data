  <h1>Two Kinds of Work</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two kinds of work. What are the two? They are Dharma work and material work. Monks, the best kind of work doesn’t go beyond the Dharma work.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Therefore, monks, you should always train in Dharma work and not in material work. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
