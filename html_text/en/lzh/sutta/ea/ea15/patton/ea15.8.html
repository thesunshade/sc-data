  <h1>Honoring the Dharma</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two things that honor the Dharma jewel as well as the shrines of the Tathāgata and gods when one contemplates and focuses of them single-mindedly. What are the two things? Possessing the powers and kinds of fearlessness. Monks, these are two things that honor the Dharma jewel and the shrines of the Tathāgata and gods when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
