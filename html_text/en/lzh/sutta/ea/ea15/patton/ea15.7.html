  <h1>Honoring the Tathāgata</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There are two things that honor the Tathāgata when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. What are the two things? The first is wisdom, and the second is complete cessation. Monks, these things honor the Tathāgata when one contemplates and focuses on them single-mindedly. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
