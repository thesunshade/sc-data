  <h1>Two Signs of a Fool</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A fool has these two signs and appearances. What are the two? Here, a fool who is incapable of accomplishing something still undertakes it, or they grow tired and abandon something they’re close to accomplishing. These, monks, are said to be two signs and appearances of a fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Furthermore, monks, a wise person has two signs and appearances. What are the two? Here, a wise person doesn’t undertake something that they can’t accomplish, and they don’t abandon something that they’re close to accomplishing …</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore, monks, these two signs and appearances of a fool should be abandoned, and you should remember and cultivate these two signs and appearances of a wise person. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
