<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One should cultivate one thing and disseminate one thing. Having cultivated one thing and disseminated one thing, they’ll attain spiritual knowledge, pacify their conditioned thinking, attain the fruits of the ascetic, and reach the abode of Nirvāṇa. What’s that one thing? It’s the practice of carefulness. What is the practice of carefulness? It’s guarding the mind. And what is guarding the mind?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Here, a monk always guards his mind against being contaminated and contaminating things. When he guards his mind against being contaminated and contaminating things, then he’ll feel comfortable around contaminating things. He’ll also become confident, remain unmoved, keep his thinking focused, and encourage himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Thus, monks, his practice is careful and he’s always cautious with himself. Then, the contaminants of desire that have yet to arise don’t arise, and the contaminants of desire that have arisen can cease. The contaminants of existence that have yet to arise don’t arise, and the contaminants of existence that have arisen can cease. The contaminants of ignorance that have yet to arise don’t arise, and the contaminants of ignorance that have arisen can cease.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>While practicing that carefulness, a monk secludes himself in a quiet place, and he’s constantly aware of himself and explores himself. He’s freed from thoughts contaminated by desire and freed from thoughts contaminated by existence and ignorance. Once he’s freed from them, he attains knowledge of that liberation: ‘Birth and death has been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I truly know that I won’t be subject to another existence.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The path of sweet dew lacks pride;<br>
Carelessness is the road of death.<br>
Without pride, one doesn’t die,<br>
While the prideful do die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Therefore, monks, one must mindfully cultivate the practice of carefulness. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
