<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “One must develop one thing and disseminate one thing. Having cultivated one thing and disseminated one thing, they’ll then attain spiritual knowledge, pacify their conditioned thinking, attain the fruits of the ascetic, and reach the abode of Nirvāṇa. What’s that one thing? It’s the practice of carefulness in the good teachings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What is this practice of carefulness? It means not harassing any sentient being, not harming any sentient being, and not troubling any sentient being. This is called the practice of carefulness. What’s called the good teachings? It means the noble eightfold path, which is right view, right method, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right discipline, right mindfulness, and right samādhi. These are the good teachings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Being generous to all sentient beings<br>
Is not the same as giving Dharma to someone.<br>
Although being generous has its merit,<br>
Giving Dharma to one person is greater.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, monks, one should cultivate the good teaching. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
