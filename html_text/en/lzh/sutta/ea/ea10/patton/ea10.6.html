  <h1>The Stingy and the Tireless</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Just as I know now the source of the destinies of sentient beings, I also know the rewards of generosity. Even the last lump of food that one doesn’t eat themselves should be given to someone else. Then, they won’t allow themselves to have even a hair’s breadth of stinginess. These sentient beings don’t know the rewards of generosity like I know them in their entirety. They are no different than the rewards of an equitable heart. Therefore, sentient beings who aren’t capable of equitable generosity bring their own downfalls. Their minds are constantly wrapped in stingy thoughts.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sentient beings don’t realize it themselves,<br>
But this is what the Tathāgata teaches:<br>
One should always be generous to all<br>
And focus on becoming a true man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>When their inclinations are purified,<br>
The merits gained are multiplied many times.<br>
Sharing equal parts of their merit,<br>
They later obtain a great reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>What they give in the present is good!<br>
Their hearts head for a broad field of merit.<br>
They depart from among humans,<br>
Sure to be born up in Heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>By reaching that good place,<br>
They’ll enjoy their own happiness.<br>
They’ll rejoice over their good fortune,<br>
And won’t be in want of anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>With heavenly authority and deeds,<br>
Beautiful women will be their followers.<br>
The rewards of equitable giving,<br>
Therefore, obtain these fortunes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
