  <h1>Recollecting Generosity</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “How should one investigate donors and almsgivers?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Bhagavān, “The Bhagavān is the king of teachings! Please, Bhagavān, teach the monks about the meaning of this. Once we’ve heard it, the monks will approve of it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then told the monks, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will discern the meaning of this for you.”</p>
<p>They replied, “Yes, Bhagavān!” The monks then accepted the teaching from the Bhagavān.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Bhagavān told them, “A donor or almsgiver should be respectful like a devoted son who supports and helps his parents. Increasing the five aggregates, he manifests various aims in this land of Jambudvīpa. Examine a donor’s ability to achieve human precepts, learning, samādhi, and wisdom. Monks, many are the benefits of the Three Jewels when they have no obstructions for those who can give you clothing, meals, furnishings, lodging, and medicine for illnesses.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, monks, one should have kind thoughts towards a donor. Never forget small favors, not to mention the large ones. Always be kind to those donors and teach them pure conduct in body, speech, and thought, which cannot be estimated or delimited. Kindness in physical action, kindness in verbal action, and kindness in mental action ensures that the gifts that donors give will never be fruitless. They will obtain great fruit, achieve great fortune, and possess great fame that’s heard throughout the world and that has the Dharma flavor of sweet dew. Thus, you monks should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Generosity achieves great riches,<br>
And it accomplishes one’s wishes, too.<br>
Neither the king nor bandits<br>
Can take that away from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Generosity gains the royal status<br>
In a line of noble wheel-turning kings.<br>
Being replete with the seven treasures<br>
Is the result of past generosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Generosity achieves a god’s body,<br>
Wearing a crown of various jewels<br>
And roaming with a harem of women.<br>
That’s a reward of past generosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>A donor becomes Śakra the Lord of Gods.<br>
That god king’s authority is abundant,<br>
And he’s adorned with a thousand eyes.<br>
That’s a reward of past generosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Generosity achieves the Buddha’s path.<br>
Endowed with the thirty-two signs,<br>
They turn the unsurpassed Dharma wheel.<br>
That’s a reward of past generosity.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved. </p>
