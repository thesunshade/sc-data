  <h1>Bad Destinies</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk cultivates one thing, then he won’t be able to destroy the bad destinies and make a destiny that’s either good or nirvāṇa. What is the one thing that when cultivated isn’t able to destroy the bad destinies? It’s a heart that lacks sincere belief. Cultivating this one thing, one won’t destroy the bad destinies.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What one thing when cultivated leads to a good place? That refers to a heart that practices sincere belief. Cultivating this one thing leads to a good place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“What one thing when cultivated reaches nirvāṇa? That refers to the constant focus of mindfulness. Cultivating this thing reaches nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, monks, focus your thinking and be mindful of the roots of goodness. Thus, monks, you should train yourselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
