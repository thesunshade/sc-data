  <h1>The Other Shore (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>A certain monk then came to visit the Buddha, prostrated at his feet, and withdrew to sit at one side. He said, “Bhagavān, there is what’s not the other shore and what is the other shore. Bhagavān, what’s not the other shore, and what is the other shore?”</p>
<p>3\.The Buddha told that monk, “Wrong view is not the other shore, but right view is the other shore. Wrong intention … wrong speech … wrong action … wrong livelihood … wrong method … wrong mindfulness … wrong samādhi is not the other shore, but right intention … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right method … right mindfulness … right samādhi is the other shore.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then spoke in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Rare are the people who can<br>
Cross over to the other shore;<br>
Everyone else in the world<br>
Wander around on this shore.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Of this right teaching and discipline,<br>
There are some who can follow it;<br>
They are the ones who can cross over<br>
That difficult ford of birth-and-death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
