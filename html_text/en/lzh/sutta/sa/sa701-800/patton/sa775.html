<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Among inner things, I don’t see a single one that can cause the arising of evil and bad things that have yet to arise or the redoubling of those that have already arisen and make them grow like not rightly considering <span class='add'>[them]</span>. Monks, not rightly considering it causes wrong view to occur that’s yet to occur and to redouble it when it has already occurred. <em>Wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong method, wrong mindfulness, and wrong </em>samādhi<em> are likewise explained.</em></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, among inner things, I don’t see a single one that prevents the arising of evil and bad things that have yet to arise or to cease those that have already arisen like rightly considering them. Monks, rightly considering it prevents wrong view from arising that’s yet to arise and ceases it when it has already arisen. <em>Wrong view, wrong intention, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong method, wrong mindfulness, and wrong </em>samādhi<em> are likewise explained.</em>”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
