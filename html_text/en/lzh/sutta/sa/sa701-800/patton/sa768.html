<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying in  Rājagṛha at a mountain valley monastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Venerable Ānanda had this thought while alone in a quiet abode, “Half of the religious practice is good friends, good associates, and good followers …”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha told Ānanda, “The religious practice is entirely, fully, and purely good friends. What is the reason for that? It was because of good friends that I led sentient beings to cultivate right view by relying on seclusion, having no desire, cessation, and being oriented toward renunciation … to cultivate right samādhi by relying on seclusion, having no desire, cessation, and an orientation towards renunciation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
