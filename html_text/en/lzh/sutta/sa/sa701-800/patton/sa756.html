<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “There’s the expression ‘immortal.’ What is it that’s called ‘immortal’? ‘Immortal’ is the name of a realm, but I take it to be the end of the contaminants of existence. That’s a clear explanation of this name.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The monks said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, isn’t there a path and steps to attaining immortality when cultivated and cultivated often?”</p>
<p>The Buddha addressed the monk, “There is. It’s known as the noble eightfold path, which is right view … right samādhi.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
