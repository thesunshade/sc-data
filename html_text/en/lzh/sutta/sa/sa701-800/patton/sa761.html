<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will explain the trainee and the adept (13.14) <em>or</em> the correct man and the great man (13.15). Listen closely and consider it well. What is a trainee <em>or</em> correct man? It means their accomplishment of right view … right intent … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called a trainee <em>or</em> correct man. What is an adept <em>or</em> great man? It means their accomplishment of right view … right intent … right speech … right action … right method … right mindfulness … accomplishment of right samādhi. This is called an adept <em>or</em> great man.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>After the Buddha spoke this <em>sūtra</em>, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
