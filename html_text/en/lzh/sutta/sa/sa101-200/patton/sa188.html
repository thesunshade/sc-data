  <h1>Impermanent, Painful, Empty, and Not Self</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “You should correctly observe the eye to be <span class='add'>[1]</span> impermanent … <span class='add'>[2]</span> painful … <span class='add'>[3]</span> empty … <span class='add'>[4]</span> not self. Such observation is called right view. Because it’s correctly observed, disillusionment arises. Because disillusionment arises, one parts with delight and greed. I say the mind is correctly liberated by parting with delight and greed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Thus, regarding the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind … one parts with delight and greed. Monks, I say the mind is correctly liberated by parting with delight and greed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Someone who’s mind is correctly liberated can declare about themselves: ‘My births have been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
