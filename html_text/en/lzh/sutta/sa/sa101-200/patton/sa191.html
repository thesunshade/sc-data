<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If someone doesn’t know and understand and doesn’t stop and become free of desire for the eye, it isn’t possible for them to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. Not knowing and understanding or stopping and becoming free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, it isn’t possible to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, if someone knows and understands and stops and becomes free of desire for the eye, it’s possible for them to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death. If they know and understand and stop and become free of desire for the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, it’s possible for them to transcend the suffering of birth, old age, illness, and death.”</p>
