  <h1>The End of the World</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I don’t say that the world has an end to which a person can travel, nor do I say that there’s an ultimate end of suffering for someone who doesn’t travel to the end of the world.” After saying this, he went into his dwelling to sit in meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>A group of monks then discussed it after the Bhagavān was gone: “The Bhagavān only gave this brief teaching: ‘I don’t say that the world has an end to which a person can travel, nor do I say that there’s an ultimate end of suffering for someone who doesn’t travel to the end of the world.’ After saying this, he went into his dwelling to sit in meditation. We’ve yet to understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching. Who among the Venerables is capable of explaining the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching for us?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Again, they said, “There’s only Venerable Ānanda. He’s wise, has a complete memory, and always attends to the Bhagavān, right and left. The Bhagavān praises him as a well-versed religious practitioner. He’s capable of explaining the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief teaching for us. Let’s go to Venerable Ānanda and request that he explain it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>That group of monks then went to Venerable Ānanda after having this discussion and sat to one side. They then asked Ānanda about the above subject.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>It was then that Ānanda told the monks, “Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you. If the world, the world’s names, the world’s feelings, the world’s expressions, and the world’s languages are all entered, the world proliferates. Venerables, that’s to say that when the eye enters the world, the world’s names, the world’s feelings, the world’s expressions, and the world’s languages, the world proliferates. <em>The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are likewise.</em></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“The well-versed noble disciple truly knows the formation, cessation, enjoyment, trouble, and escape from the six sense fields. This is called the noble disciple who travels to the end of the world, knows the world, is respected by the world, and traverses the world.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>It was then that Venerable Ānanda restated this in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“It’s not by traveling on foot<br>
That the end of the world is reached;<br>
Not reaching the end of the world,<br>
Myriad pains can’t be escaped.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Therefore, the honored sage<br>
Is called ‘Knower of the World;’<br>
Able to reach the end of the world,<br>
He established the religious practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The end of the world is only something<br>
Truly understood with right knowledge;<br>
Awakened wisdom penetrates the world,<br>
Which is called ‘crossing to the other side.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“So it is, Venerables! The Bhagavān only gave this brief teaching and went into his dwelling to sit in meditation. Now, I’ve discerned and explained it in detail for you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>After Venerable Ānanda explained this teaching, that group of monks who heard what he taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
