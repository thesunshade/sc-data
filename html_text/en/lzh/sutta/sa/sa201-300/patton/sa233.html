<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān told the monks, “Now, I will discuss the world, the world’s formation, the world’s cessation, and the path to the world’s cessation. Listen closely, and well consider it!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What is the world? It’s the six inner sense fields. What are the six? The inner sense field of the eye … ear … nose … tongue … body … the inner sense field of the mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“What is the world’s formation? It’s craving, delight, and greed for a future existence. Those things are attached to its formation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“What is the world’s cessation? There’s craving, delight, and greed for a future existence. The attachment of those things to its formation is stopped without remainder. Having been abandoned, rejected, and ended, then one is free of desire, and it ceases, stops, and disappears.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“What is the path to the world’s cessation? It’s the eightfold path, which is right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right method, right mindfulness, and right samādhi.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
