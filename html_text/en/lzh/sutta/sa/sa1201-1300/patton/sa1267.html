  <h1>Crossing the Flood</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that a god with a marvelous appearance visited the Buddha late at night. That god bowed at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to sit to one side. The radiance of its body completely illuminated Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park and Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>That god then asked the Buddha, “Bhagavān! Monk, monk! Did you cross the flood?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Yes, god.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The god again asked, “Did you cross the flood without any support and no place to stand?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said, “Yes, god.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The god again asked, “What do you mean, you crossed the flood without any support and no place to stand?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a> The Buddha said, “God, when I held on again and again or moved forward again and again, I wasn’t carried away by the water. When I didn’t hold on again and again and didn’t move forward again and again, I was carried away by the water. This, god, is called crossing the flood without any support and no place to stand.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>That god spoke again in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Long have I watched this priest<br>
Who has won parinirvāṇa.<br>
Having gone beyond all fear,<br>
He has forever transcended love of the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>When that god heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and was delighted. He bowed to the Buddha’s feet and disappeared.</p>
