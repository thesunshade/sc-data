<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that a certain monk came to the Buddha. <span class='add'>[He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, and withdrew to stand to one side. He then said, “It’d be good, Bhagavān, if you would briefly explain the Dharma for me now. After hearing the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place and cultivate it earnestly. After cultivating it earnestly, I’ll again contemplate: ‘A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home to train on the path. That’s the way he reaches the ultimate and unsurpassed religious life. He’ll realize in the present life: “My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”]</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><span class='add'>[The Bhagavān told that monk, “Good, good! Monk, I’m glad you’ve said, ‘Bhagavān, give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. From that brief explanation of the Dharma, I will get a full understanding of its meaning. I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’”’? Is this what you said?”]</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>[The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”]</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><span class='add'>[The Buddha told the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk,]</span> if something brings about the tendencies and brings about death, then it increases in number. Monk, if it doesn’t bring about the tendencies or bring about death, then it doesn’t increase in number.”</p>
<p><span class='add'>[The monk said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”]</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The Buddha asked the monk, “How do you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>That monk then said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, suppose form brings about the tendencies and brings about death. Something that brings about the tendencies and brings about death increases in number. Thus, suppose feeling … conception … volition … consciousness brings about the tendencies and brings about death. Something that brings about the tendencies and brings about death increases in number.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Bhagavān, suppose form doesn’t bring about the tendencies and doesn’t bring about death. Something that doesn’t bring about the tendencies or bring about death doesn’t increase in number. Thus, suppose feeling … conception … volition … consciousness doesn’t bring about the tendencies and doesn’t bring about death. Something that doesn’t bring about the tendencies or bring about death doesn’t increase in number. I understand the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in this way.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><span class='add'>[The Buddha told the monk, “Good! It’s good, monk, that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? Suppose form brings about the tendencies and brings about death. Something that brings about the tendencies and brings about death increases in number. Thus, suppose feeling … conception … volition … consciousness brings about the tendencies and brings about death. Something that brings about the tendencies and brings about death increases in number.]</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><span class='add'>[“Suppose form doesn’t bring about the tendencies and doesn’t bring about death.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><span class='add'>[When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he felt great joy. He bowed to the Buddha and withdrew. He went alone to a quiet place where he diligently trained and lived earnestly. After diligently training and living earnestly, he thought, “A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> … ‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”]</span></p>
