<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>There was then a certain monk who rose from his seat, <span class='add'>[adjusted his robes to bare his right shoulder,]</span> bowed to the Buddha, <span class='add'>[and withdrew to stand at one side]</span>. He then said to the Buddha, “<span class='add'>[It would be good,]</span> Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I will go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly. Having lived earnestly, I’ll then think, “A good son leaves home, cuts off his hair and beard, puts on the Dharma robes, believes at home in being homeless, and leaves home … <em>up to</em> … ‘“I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.”’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān then told that monk, “Good, good! Did you say, ‘It would be good, Bhagavān, if you were to give me a brief explanation of the Dharma. Having listened to the Dharma, I’ll go alone to a quiet place, focus on contemplation, and live earnestly … <em>up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’”’? <span class='add'>[Is this what you said?]</span>”</p>
<p>The monk said to the Buddha, “Yes, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha addressed the monk, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. Monk, if one is shaken, they are tied up by Māra. If one isn’t shaken, then they are free of Māra.”</p>
<p>That monk then said to the Buddha, “I’ve understood, Bhagavān! I’ve understood, Sugata!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The Buddha said to the monk, “How do you understand my brief explanation of the Dharma in full?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>The monk said to the Buddha, “Bhagavān, if form shakes <span class='add'>[a person]</span>, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, if feeling … conception … volition … consciousness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Therefore, I understand the meaning of the Bhagavān’s brief explanation of the Dharma in full.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>The Buddha said, “Good! It’s good, monk, that you understand the meaning of my brief explanation of the Dharma in full. Why is that? If form shakes a person, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra. Thus, if feeling … conception … volition … consciousness shakes them, then they are tied up by Māra. If someone isn’t shaken by it, then they are free of Māra.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>… <em>Up to</em> … “‘I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence’” … His mind was liberated, and he became an <em>arhat</em>.”</p>
