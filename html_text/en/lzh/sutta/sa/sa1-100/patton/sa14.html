<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “In the past, I had the pursuits and practices of enjoying form. When I realized the enjoyment of form as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of enjoying feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the enjoyment of feeling … conception … volition … consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of form’s trouble. When I realized form’s trouble as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of feeling’s … conception’s … volition’s … consciousness’s trouble. When I realized consciousness’s trouble as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping form. When I realized the escape from form as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom. Thus, I had the pursuits and practices of escaping feeling … conception … volition … consciousness. When I realized the escape from consciousness as a result, I truly saw it with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, had I not truly known the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, I would have forever stood in delusion among the gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests in the assemblies of gods and humans, and I wouldn’t have been freed from, parted with, and escaped from <span class='add'>[these aggregates]</span>. I couldn’t have realized my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monks, I did truly know the enjoyment of the five acquired aggregates to be enjoyment … trouble to be trouble … escape to be escape, and I never again stood in delusion among the gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests in the assemblies of gods and humans, and I was freed from, parted with, and escaped from <span class='add'>[these aggregates]</span>. I could realize my attainment of the unsurpassed and complete awakening.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
