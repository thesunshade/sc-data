<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A faithful good son should have this thought, ‘I should follow the teaching. I will often cultivate disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivate disillusionment with consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“A faithful good son then often cultivates disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivates disillusionment with consciousness. He becomes disillusioned with form … feeling … conception … volition … becomes disillusioned with consciousness. After being disillusioned, he parts with desire for it and is liberated from it. Being liberated, he knows and sees: ‘My births have been ended, the religious life has been established, and the task has been accomplished. I myself know that I won’t be subject to a later existence.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
