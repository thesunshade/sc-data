  <h1>Rāhula’s Question (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at the Kalandaka Bamboo Grove of Rājagṛha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed Rāhula, “How does a monk know and how does he see this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world such that he has no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride?”</p>
<p>Rāhula said to the Buddha, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma lord, a guide, and a refuge. It would be good, Bhagavān, if you would give a detailed discourse on this subject for the monks! After they hear it, the monks will accept and approve of it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha told Rāhula, “Listen closely! Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain it for you.</p>
<p>Rāhula said to the Buddha, “Very well, I’ll accept the teaching.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha told Rāhula, “You should observe that whatever forms there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other. They are truly observed with equitable wisdom in this way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Thus, whatever feelings … conceptions … volitions … consciousnesses there are, whether they are past, future, or present, internal or external, crude or fine, beautiful or ugly, or distant or near, they are all not self, not different than self, and neither are present in the other. They are truly observed with equitable wisdom in this way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“A monk who knows and sees this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world in this way will have no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Rāhula, if a monk has no binding attachments to views of self and what belongs to self or to the tendency of self pride regarding this body of consciousness and all the signs of the external world, he goes beyond doubts, becomes free of these signs, and is peacefully liberated. That monk is called one who has stopped craving desires and turned away from the bonds. Right at that moment, he reaches the final end of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>When Rāhula heard what the Buddha taught, he rejoiced and approved.</p>
