  <h1>Samṛddhi’s Question</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>There was then a certain monk named Samṛddhi who came to visit the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet and withdrew to stand to one side. He then said to the Buddha, “As the Bhagavān says ‘the teaching of a Dharma teacher,’ what’s called the teaching of a Dharma teacher?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Buddha asked the monk, “<span class='add'>[Good, good!]</span> Do you want now to know the meaning of ‘the teaching of a Dharma teacher’?”</p>
<p>The monk said to the Buddha, “Indeed, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha told the monk, “<span class='add'>[Listen closely!]</span> Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you. If a monk teaches disillusionment with form, being free of desire for it, and completely ceasing it, this is called the teaching of a Dharma teacher. Thus with feeling … conception … volition … consciousness, he teaches disillusionment with consciousness, being free of desire for it, and completely ceasing it. This is called the teaching of a Dharma teacher.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When that monk heard what the Buddha taught, he celebrated and rejoiced. He then bowed and departed.</p>
