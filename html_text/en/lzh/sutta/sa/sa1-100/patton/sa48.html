<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a> It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “A good son of correct faith who’s not at home and has left home thinks to himself, ‘I should follow the teaching. I will often cultivate disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivate disillusionment with consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“A good son who is correctly faithful, not at home, and has left home then often cultivates disillusionment with form … feeling … conception … volition … often cultivates disillusionment with consciousness. He becomes disillusioned with form … feeling … conception … volition … becomes disillusioned with consciousness. He then attains the escape from form … feeling … conception … volition … attains the escape from consciousness. I say that he will be free from all birth, old age, illness, death, grief, sorrow, pain, and trouble.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
