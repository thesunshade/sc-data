  <h1>What’s Destroyed</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Now, I will discuss things that are destroyed and not destroyed. Listen closely, and consider it well. I will explain this for you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, form is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment of that form is not something that’s destroyed. Feeling … conception … volition … consciousness is something destroyed, but the cessation and extinguishment of that consciousness is not something that’s destroyed.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After the Buddha spoke this sūtra, the monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
