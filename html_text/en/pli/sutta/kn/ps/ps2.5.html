<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en324' href='#pts-vp-en324'>PTS vp En 324</a>1. Fading away is the path, deliverance is its fruit.</p>
<p>2. How is fading away the path?</p>
<p>At the moment of the stream-entry path:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing fades away from wrong view, and it fades away from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it fades away from all signs.</p>
<p>Fading away has fading away as its supporting object, has fading away as its domain, is erected upon fading away, stands upon fading away, is founded upon fading away.</p>
<p><i>Fading away</i>: there are two kinds of fading away: (1) fading away as nibbana; and (2) fading away described thus “All ideas born with nibbana as their supporting object are kinds of fading away”.</p>
<p>The seven path factors conascent <span class='add'>[with right view]</span> go to fading away, thus fading away is a path. By that path the Buddhas and their disciples go in a direction not gone in <span class='add'>[before]</span>, namely, nibbana, thus the path is eightfold. With all the paths there are in the other beliefs of the many ascetics and brahmans, nevertheless the noble eightfold path is the highest, the best, the principal, the foremost, the most valuable, thus the eightfold is the best of paths.</p>
<p>Right thought in the sense of directing onto fades away from wrong thought … <span class='add'>[complete as above with appropriate substitutions]</span> …</p>
<p>Right speaking …</p>
<p>Right acting …</p>
<p>Right living …</p>
<p>Right effort …</p>
<p>Right mindfulness …</p>
<p>Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction … … thus the eightfold is the best of paths.</p>
<p>3. At the moment of the once-return path:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing …</p>
<p>Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction fades away from the gross fetters of greed for sensual-desires and of resistance, from the gross underlying tendencies to greed for sensual-desires and to resistance, and it fades away from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it fades away from all signs.</p>
<p>Fading away has fading away as its supporting object, …</p>
<p><i>Fading away</i>: two kinds of fading away: …</p>
<p>The <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en325' href='#pts-vp-en325'>PTS vp En 325</a> seven path factors … thus the eightfold is the best of paths.</p>
<p>4. At the moment of the non-return path:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing …</p>
<p>Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction fades away from secondary fetters of greed for sensual-desires and of resistance, from secondary underlying tendencies to greed for sensual-desires and to resistance, and it fades away from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it fades away from all signs.</p>
<p>Fading away has fading away as its supporting object …</p>
<p><i>Fading away</i>: two kinds of fading away: …</p>
<p>The seven path factors … thus the eightfold is the best of paths.</p>
<p>5. At the moment of the arahant path:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing …</p>
<p>Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction fades away from greed for material <span class='add'>[being]</span>, from greed for immaterial <span class='add'>[being]</span>, from conceit (pride), from agitation, from ignorance, from the underlying tendencies to conceit (pride), to greed for being and to ignorance, and it fades away from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it fades away from all signs.</p>
<p>Fading away has fading away as its supporting object …</p>
<p><i>Fading away</i>: two kinds of fading away: …</p>
<p>The seven path factors … thus the eightfold is the best of paths.</p>
<p>6. Fading away as seeing is right view. Fading away as directing onto is right thought. Fading away as embracing is right speaking. Fading away as originating is right acting. Fading away as cleansing is right living. Fading away as exerting is right effort. Fading away as establishing is right mindfulness. Fading away as non-distraction is right concentration. Fading away as establishing is the mindfulness enlightenment factor. Fading away as investigating is the investigation-of-ideas enlightenment factor. Fading away as exerting is the energy enlightenment factor. Fading away as intentness upon is the happiness enlightenment factor. Fading away as peace is the tranquillity enlightenment factor. Fading away as non-distraction is the concentration enlightenment factor. Fading away as reflexion is the equanimity enlightenment factor.</p>
<p>Fading away as unshakability by non-faith is the faith power. Fading away as unshakability by idleness is the energy power. Fading away as unshakability by negligence is the mindfulness power. Fading away as unshakability by agitation is the concentration power. Fading away as unshakability by ignorance is the understanding power.</p>
<p>Fading <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en326' href='#pts-vp-en326'>PTS vp En 326</a> away as resolution is the faith faculty. Fading away as exertion is the energy faculty. Fading away as establishment is the mindfulness faculty. Fading away as non-distraction is the concentration faculty. Fading away as seeing is the understanding faculty.</p>
<p>The faculties are fading away in the sense of dominance. The powers are fading away in the sense of unshakability. The enlightenment factors are fading away in the sense of outlet. The path is fading away in the sense of cause. The foundations of mindfulness are fading away in the sense of establishment. The right endeavours are fading away in the sense of endeavouring. The bases for success (roads to power) are fading away in the sense of succeeding. The actualities are fading away in the sense of suchness (reality).</p>
<p>Serenity is fading away in the sense of non-distraction. Insight is fading away in the sense of contemplation. Serenity and insight are fading away in the sense of single function (taste). Coupling is fading away in the sense of non-excess.</p>
<p>Purification of virtue is fading away in the sense of restraint. Purification of cognizance is fading away in the sense of non-distraction. Purification of view is fading away in the sense of seeing. Liberation is fading away in the sense of being freed. Recognition is fading away in the sense of penetration. Deliverance is fading away in the sense of giving up. Knowledge of exhaustion is fading away in the sense of cutting off.</p>
<p>In the sense of root, zeal is fading away. In the sense of origination, attention is fading away. In the sense of combining, contact is fading away. In the sense of meeting place, feeling is fading away. In the sense of being foremost, concentration is fading away. In the sense of dominance, mindfulness is fading away. In the sense of being highest of all, understanding is fading away. In the sense of being the core (taste), deliverance is fading away. In the sense of end, nibbana which merges in the deathless is fading away.</p>
<p>That is how fading away is the path.</p>
<p>7. How is deliverance its fruit?</p>
<p>At the moment of stream-entry fruition:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing is delivered from wrong view, and it is delivered from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it is delivered from all signs.</p>
<p>Deliverance has deliverance as its supporting object, has deliverance for its domain, is erected upon deliverance, stands upon deliverance, is founded upon deliverance.</p>
<p><i>Deliverance</i>: <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en327' href='#pts-vp-en327'>PTS vp En 327</a> there are two kinds of deliverance: (1) deliverance as nibbana, and (2) deliverance as fruit described thus “All ideas born with nibbana as their supporting object are delivered”.</p>

<p>Right effort …</p>

<p>8. At the moment of once-return fruition:</p>
<p>Right view in the sense of seeing …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Right concentration in the sense of non-distraction is delivered from the gross fetters of greed for sensual-desires and of resistance, from the gross underlying tendencies to greed for sensual-desires and to resistance, and it is delivered from defilements and from aggregates that occur consequent upon them, and externally it is delivered from all signs.</p>
<p>Deliverance has deliverance as its supporting object, …</p>

<p>11. Deliverance as seeing is right view. Deliverance as directing onto is right thought … Deliverance as non-distraction is right concentration.</p>
<p>Deliverance as establishing is the mindfulness enlightenment factor. Deliverance as investigating is the investigation-of-ideas enlightenment factor … Deliverance as reflexion is the equanimity enlightenment factor.</p>
<p>Deliverance as unshakability by non-faith is the faith power … Deliverance as unshakability by ignorance is the understanding power.</p>
<p>Deliverance as resolution is the faith faculty … Deliverance as seeing is the understanding faculty.</p>
<p>The faculties are deliverance in the sense of dominance. The powers are deliverance in the sense of unshakability … The actualities are deliverance in the sense of suchness (reality).</p>

<p>That is how deliverance is its fruit.</p>
<p>That is how fading away is the path, deliverance is its fruit.</p>
