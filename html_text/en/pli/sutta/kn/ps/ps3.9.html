<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en401' href='#pts-vp-en401'>PTS vp En 401</a>1. “Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus, thus: ‘Bhikkhus’. ‘Venerable Sir' they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p>2. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees any formation as permanent it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span>, and without making a choice in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span> it is not possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of rightness, and without entering upon the certainty of rightness it is not possible that he shall realize the fruit of stream-entry or the fruit of once-return or the fruit of non-return or the fruit of arahantship. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees all formations as impermanent it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span>, and making a choice in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span> it is possible that he shall enter upon the certainty of rightness, and by entering upon the certainty of rightness it is possible that he shall realize the fruit of stream-entry, or the fruit of once-return, or the fruit of non-return, or the fruit of arahantship.</p>
<p>3. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees any formation as pleasant it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees all formations as painful it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship.</p>
<p>4. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees any idea as self it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees all ideas as not self it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship.</p>
<p>5. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees nibbana as painful it is not possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship. Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu sees nibbana as pleasant it is possible that he shall make a choice in conformity, and … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 2 up to]</span> … or the fruit of arahantship”.</p>
<p>6. In how many aspects does he choose in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span>? In how many aspects does he enter upon the certainty of rightness?</p>
<p>He <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en402' href='#pts-vp-en402'>PTS vp En 402</a> chooses in conformity <span class='add'>[with actuality]</span> in forty aspects. He enters upon the certainty of rightness in forty aspects.</p>
<p>7. In what forty aspects does he choose in conformity?</p>
<p>In what forty aspects does he enter upon the certainty of rightness?</p>
<p><span class='add'>[He sees]</span> the five aggregates as impermanent, as painful, as a disease, a boil, a dart, a calamity, an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as a plague, a disaster, a terror, a menace, as fickle, perishable, unenduring, as no protection, no shelter, no refuge, as empty, vain, void, not self, as a danger, as subject to change, as having no core, as the root of calamity, as murderous, as due to be annihilated, as subject to cankers, as formed, as Māra's bait, as connected with the idea of birth, connected with the idea of ageing, connected with the idea of illness, connected with the idea of death, connected with the idea of sorrow, connected with the idea of lamentation, connected with the idea of despair, connected with the idea of defilement.</p>
