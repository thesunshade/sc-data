<p>86. When any ideas which someone is making an effort to obtain are obtained by him, they are accordingly fully understood and judged (investigated).</p>
<p>When renunciation which someone is making an effort to obtain is obtained by him, it is accordingly fully understood and judged (investigated). <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en26' href='#pts-vp-en26'>PTS vp En 26</a> When non-ill-will … When perception of light … When non-distraction … When definition of ideas … When knowledge … When gladness … When the first jhana … When the second jhana … When the third jhana … When the fourth jhana …</p>

<h3>Section iii</h3>
<p><i>88. How is it that understanding of applying the ear thus “These ideas are to be abandoned” is knowledge of what consists in the heard (learnt)?</i></p>
<h4>Ten Propositions</h4>
<p>89. One idea to be abandoned: The conceit “I am”.</p>
<p>Two <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en27' href='#pts-vp-en27'>PTS vp En 27</a> ideas to be abandoned: ignorance, and craving for being.</p>
<p>Three ideas to be abandoned: three sorts of craving (for sensual-desires, for being, for non-being).</p>
<p>Four ideas to be abandoned: the four floods.</p>
<p>Five ideas to be abandoned: the five hindrances.</p>
<p>Six ideas to be abandoned: the six classes of craving.</p>
<p>Seven ideas to be abandoned: the seven underlying tendencies.</p>
<p>Eight ideas to be abandoned: the eight wrongnesses (opposites of the eightfold path).</p>
<p>Nine ideas to be abandoned: the nine ideas rooted in craving.</p>
<p>Ten ideas to be abandoned: the ten wrongnesses (the eight plus wrong knowledge and wrong deliverance).</p>
<p>90. Two kinds of abandoning: Abandoning by cutting off and abandoning by tranquillization. Abandoning by cutting off comes about in one who develops the supramundane path leading to the destruction (of defilement), and abandoning by tranquillization comes about at the moment of fruition.</p>
<p>Three kinds of abandoning: The escape from sensual-desires consists in this, namely, renunciation; the escape from any kinds of materiality consists in this, namely, immateriality; the escape from whatever is, is formed, is dependently arisen, consists in this, namely, cessation. Sensual-desires are abandoned and given up in one who has obtained renunciation. Any kinds of materiality are abandoned and given up in one who has obtained the immaterial. Formations are abandoned and given up in one who has obtained cessation.</p>
<p>Four kinds of abandoning: when penetration consisting in full understanding penetrates the actuality of suffering, it abandons; when penetration consisting in abandoning penetrates the actuality of origination, it abandons; when penetration consisting in realization penetrates the actuality of cessation, it abandons; when penetration consisting in development penetrates the actuality of the path, it abandons.</p>
<p>Five kinds of abandoning: abandoning by suppression, abandoning by substitution of opposites, abandoning by cutting off, abandoning by tranquillization, abandoning by escaping. There is abandoning of the hindrances by suppression in one who develops the first jhana; abandoning of (wrong) views by substitution of opposites in one who develops concentration partaking of penetration; abandoning (of defilements) by <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en28' href='#pts-vp-en28'>PTS vp En 28</a> cutting off in one who develops the supramundane path leading to the destruction (of defilement); abandoning (of the effort of development) by tranquillization at the moment of fruition (of the path); abandoning by escaping is cessation, nibbana.</p>
<h4>All</h4>
<p>91. “Bhikkhus, all is to be abandoned. And what is all that is to be abandoned? Eye is to be abandoned, visible objects are to be abandoned, eye consciousness is to be abandoned, eye contact is to be abandoned, any feeling that arises with eye contact as its condition whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant is also to be abandoned. Ear is to be abandoned, sounds … Nose is to be abandoned, odours … Tongue is to be abandoned, flavours … Body is to be abandoned, tangible objects … Mind is to be abandoned, ideas are to be abandoned, mind consciousness is to be abandoned, mind contact is to be abandoned, any feeling that arises with mind contact as its condition whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant is to be abandoned”.</p>
<h4>201 Ideas</h4>
<p>92. When he sees materiality he abandons. When he sees feeling … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 5 up to]</span> … When he sees ageing-and-death he abandons.</p>
<p>93–129. When he sees suffering he abandons. When he sees the origin … <span class='add'>[and so on as in §§ 6–43 up to]</span> … When he sees nibbana which merges in the deathless in its meaning of ending he abandons.</p>
<p>130. Any ideas that are abandoned are given up. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “The ear is applied thus: These ideas are to be abandoned. Understanding as the act of understanding that is knowledge of what consists in the heard (learnt)”.</p>

As to development of immaterial-sphere profitable ideas, there is the inferior, the medium and the superior kind. As to development of unincluded profitable ideas there is (only) the superior kind.</p>
<p>Four kinds of development: when penetration consisting in full understanding penetrates the actuality of suffering, it develops; when penetration consisting in abandoning penetrates the actuality of origination, it develops; when penetration consisting in realization penetrates the actuality of cessation, it develops; when penetration consisting of developing penetrates the actuality of the path, it develops. These are four kinds of development.</p>
<p>134. Four more kinds of development: development as search, development as obtainment, development as single function, development as repetition.</p>
<p>What is <i>development as search</i>? When anyone is entering upon concentration, the ideas produced in him have a single function (namely deliverance): this is development as search (for absorption).</p>
<p>What is <i>development as obtainment</i>? When anyone has entered upon concentration, the ideas produced in him do not exceed each other, this is development as obtainment (of absorption).</p>

<p>What is the virtue that has life as its limit? Here someone with life as cause, with life as condition, with life as reason, transgresses a training precept as undertaken: such virtue has life as its limit.</p>
<p>Such kinds of virtue are torn, rent, blotched, mottled, they are not liberating, not commended by the wise; they are misapprehended, not conducive to concentration, not a basis for non-remorse, not a basis for gladness, not a basis for happiness, not a basis for tranquillity, not a basis for bliss, not a basis for concentration, not a basis for correct knowledge and seeing; they do not lead to complete dispassion, to fading of greed, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana: such virtue has a limit.</p>

<p>Such kinds of virtue are untorn, unrent, unblotched, unmottled, they are liberating, commended by the wise, unmisapprehended, conducive to concentration, a basis for non-remorse, a basis for gladness, a basis for happiness, a basis for tranquillity, a basis for bliss, a basis for concentration, a basis for correct knowledge and seeing, they lead to complete dispassion, to fading of greed, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana: such virtue has no limit.</p>
<p>260. What is virtue? How many kinds of virtue are there? From what does virtue originate? With how many ideas does virtue combine?</p>
<p>261. <i>What is virtue</i>? There is virtue as volition, virtue as consciousness concomitant, virtue as restraint, virtue as non-transgression.</p>
<p>262. <i>How many kinds of virtue are there</i>? There are three kinds of virtue (habit); profitable virtue (habit), unprofitable virtue (habit), indeterminate virtue (habit).</p>
<p>263. <i>From what does virtue originate</i>? Profitable virtue (habit) originates from profitable cognizance, unprofitable virtue (habit) originates from unprofitable cognizance, indeterminate virtue (habit) originates from indeterminate cognizance.</p>
<p>264. <i>With how many ideas does virtue combine</i>?</p>
<p>Virtue combines with restraint, virtue combines with non-transgression, virtue combines with the volition produced about such an idea <span class='add'>[as restraint or non-transgression]</span>.</p>

<p>265. Five kinds of virtue.</p>
<p>In the case of killing living things abandoning is virtue, abstention is virtue, volition is virtue, restraint is virtue, non-transgression is virtue. Such virtues lead to non-remorse cognizance, to gladness, to happiness, to tranquillity, to joy, to repetition, to development, to making much of, to embellishment, to the requisite <span class='add'>[for concentration]</span>, to the equipment <span class='add'>[of concentration]</span>, to perfection, to complete dispassion, to fading away of greed, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to nibbana: the purification consisting in restraint in such virtues is the higher virtue. Cognizance established in the purification consisting in restraint does not become distracted: the purification consisting in non-distraction is the higher cognizance. He sees the purification consisting in restraint correctly, and he sees the purification consisting in non-distraction correctly: the purification consisting in seeing is the higher understanding. The meaning of restraint therein is training in the higher virtue, the meaning of non-distraction therein is training in the higher cognizance, the meaning of seeing therein is training in the higher understanding. He trains by adverting to these three kinds of training, he trains by knowing them, by seeing them, by reviewing them, by steadying <span class='add'>[cognizance]</span> upon them, by resolving with faith upon them, by exerting energy upon them, by establishing mindfulness upon them, by concentrating cognizance upon them, by understanding them with understanding, by directly knowing what is to be directly known, by fully understanding what is to be fully understood, by abandoning what is to be abandoned, by realizing what is to be realized, he trains by developing what should be developed.</p>
<p>In the case of taking what is not given … <span class='add'>[and so on with the rest of the ten courses of unprofitable [action]</span> as in § 264, repeating the remainder of § 265 above in each instance] …</p>

<p>Through <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en48' href='#pts-vp-en48'>PTS vp En 48</a> contemplation of impermanence in the case of perception of permanence …</p>
<p>Through the stream-entry path in the case of the defilements coefficient with wrong view … Through the once-return path in the case of gross defilements … Through the non-return path in the case of secondary defilements … Through the arahant path in the case of all defilements abandoning is virtue, abstention is virtue, volition is virtue, restraint is virtue, non-transgression is virtue. Such virtue leads to non-remorse cognizance, … he trains by developing what should be developed.</p>
<p>266. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of restraint after hearing (learning) is knowledge of what consists in virtue”.</p>
<h2>III. Concentration</h2>
<p><i>267. How is it that understanding of concentrating after restraining is knowledge of what consists in the development of concentration?</i></p>

<p>Nine kinds of concentration: There is inferior, medium and superior material concentration; there is inferior, medium and superior immaterial concentration; there is void concentration; there is signless concentration; there is desireless concentration.</p>
<p>Ten kinds of concentration: Concentration as mental unification and non-distraction through the bloated, concentration … through the livid … through the festering … through the cut-up … through the gnawed … through the scattered … through the hacked and scattered … through the bleeding … through the worm-infested … concentration as mental unification and non-distraction through a skeleton.</p>
<p>These are fifty-five kinds of concentration.</p>
<p>269. Furthermore there are twenty-five meanings of concentration: Concentration in the meaning of embracing, concentration in the meaning of equipment, … in the meaning of fulfilment, … of unification, … of non-distraction, … of non-dissipation, … of non-commotion, … of non-perturbation, … concentration in the meaning of deliverance, concentration owing to steadiness of cognizance through establishment in unity, concentration (<i>samādhi</i>) since it seeks sameness (<i>samaṃ</i>), concentration since it does not seek unsameness, concentration owing to sameness being sought, concentration owing to unsameness not being sought, concentration since it grasps sameness, concentration since it does not grasp unsameness, concentration owing to sameness being grasped, concentration owing to unsameness not being grasped, concentration since it enters upon sameness, concentration since it does not enter upon unsameness, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en50' href='#pts-vp-en50'>PTS vp En 50</a> concentration owing to sameness being entered upon, concentration owing to unsameness not being entered upon, concentration since sameness is lighted (<i>jhāyati</i>), concentration since it consumes (<i>jhāpeti</i>) unsameness, concentration owing to sameness being ignited, concentration owing to unsameness being consumed, concentration since it is sameness, welfare and pleasure. These are twenty-five meanings of concentration.</p>
<p>270. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of concentrating after restraining is knowledge of what consists in the development of concentration”.</p>
<h2>IV. Dependent Origination</h2>

Understanding of embracing conditions thus: “In the past and in the future birth is a cause, ageing-and-death is causally arisen, and both these ideas are causally arisen” is knowledge of the causal relationship of ideas.</p>
<p>273. Understanding of embracing conditions thus: “Ignorance is dependent, formations are dependently arisen, and both these ideas are dependent arisen”, is knowledge of the causal relationship of ideas. Understanding of embracing conditions thus: “In the past and in the future ignorance is dependent, formations are dependently arisen, and both these <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en52' href='#pts-vp-en52'>PTS vp En 52</a> ideas are dependently arisen” is knowledge … <span class='add'>[complete as in § 272, but substituting “<i>dependent</i>” for “<i>cause</i>”]</span></p>

<p>He defines thus: Eye is produced by ignorance. He defines thus: Eye is produced by craving … Eye is produced by action … Eye is produced by nutriment … Eye is derived <span class='add'>[by clinging]</span> from the four great entities … Eye is arisen … He defines thus: Eye is arrived at. He defines thus: Eye, not having been, having been produced, will not be. He defines eye as spatially finite. He defines thus: Eye is unlasting, uneternal, subject to change. He defines thus: Eye is impermanent, formed, dependently-arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation. He defines the eye as impermanent, not as permanent; he defines it as painful, not as pleasant; he defines it as not self, not as self; he becomes dispassionate, he does not delight; he causes the fading of greed, he does not inflame it; he causes cessation, he does not originate; he relinquishes, he does not grasp. Defining as impermanent, he abandons perception of permanence; defining as painful, he abandons perception of pleasure; defining as not self, he abandons perception of self; becoming dispassionate, he abandons delighting; causing fading away, he abandons greed; causing cessation, he abandons originating; relinquishing, he abandons grasping.

<p>389. What is behaviour of consciousness?</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of seeing visible objects is a behaviour of consciousness. The meaning of seeing visible objects as eye-consciousness is a behaviour of consciousness. Resultant mind-principle <span class='add'>[occurring]</span> as the act of directing onto <span class='add'>[the object]</span> because visible objects have been seen is a behaviour of consciousness. Resultant mind-consciousness-principle <span class='add'>[occurring]</span> because of the directing onto visible objects is a behaviour of consciousness.</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of hearing sounds is a behaviour of consciousness. The meaning of hearing sounds as ear consciousness is a behaviour of consciousness … <span class='add'>[and so on as above]</span> …</p>

<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of tasting flavours …</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of touching tangible objects …</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of cognizing ideas is a behaviour of consciousness. The meaning of cognizing ideas as mind-consciousness is a behaviour of consciousness. Resultant mind-principle <span class='add'>[occurring]</span> as the act of directing onto <span class='add'>[the object]</span> because ideas have been cognized is a behaviour of consciousness. Resultant mind-consciousness-principle <span class='add'>[occurring]</span> because of the directing onto ideas is a behaviour of consciousness.</p>
<p>390. Behaviour of consciousness: In what sense behaviour of consciousness?</p>
<p>It behaves without greed: this is a behaviour of consciousness. It behaves without hate: this is a behaviour of consciousness. It behaves without delusion: … It behaves without conceit (pride): … It behaves without <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves without agitation: … It behaves without uncertainty: … It behaves without underlying tendency: … It behaves dissociated from greed: … It behaves dissociated from hate: … It behaves dissociated from delusion: … It behaves dissociated from conceit (pride): … It behaves dissociated from <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves dissociated from agitation: … It behaves dissociated from uncertainty: … It behaves dissociated from underlying tendency: … It behaves dissociated from profitable actions … It behaves dissociated from unprofitable actions: … It behaves dissociated from reprehensible actions: … It behaves dis<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en79' href='#pts-vp-en79'>PTS vp En 79</a>sociated from unreprehensible actions: … It behaves dissociated from dark actions: … It behaves dissociated from bright actions: … It behaves dissociated from pleasure-yielding actions: … It behaves dissociated from pain-yielding actions: … It behaves dissociated from actions resulting in pleasure: … It behaves dissociated from actions resulting in pain: … It behaves towards what is cognized <span class='add'>[object]</span>: This is a behaviour of consciousness. Such is the behaviour of consciousness: this is a behaviour of consciousness. This cognizance is naturally pure in the sense of absence of defilement: this is a behaviour of consciousness.</p>
<p>This is behaviour of consciousness.</p>
<p>391. What is behaviour of unknowing?</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of greed for agreeable visible objects is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of greed is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of hate for disagreeable visible objects is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of hate is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of delusion for an object irrespective of either <span class='add'>[greed or hate]</span> is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of delusion is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of conceit (pride) as a shackle is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of conceit (pride) is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of impulsion of <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view as misapprehension is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of agitation as distraction is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of agitation is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of impulsion of uncertainty as unconclusiveness is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of uncertainty is behaviour of unknowing. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of impulsion of underlying-tendency as inveteracy is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of underlying-tendency is behaviour of unknowing.</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of the impulsion of greed for sounds is behaviour of consciousness: the act of impulsion of greed is behaviour of unknowing. The act … <span class='add'>[and so on as above]</span> …</p>

<p>It behaves with greed: this is a behaviour of unknowing. It behaves with hate: this is a behaviour of unknowing. It behaves with delusion: this is a behaviour of unknowing. It behaves with conceit (pride): this is a behaviour of unknowing … It behaves with <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves with agitation: … It behaves with uncertainty: … It behaves with underlying tendency: … It behaves associated with greed: … It behaves associated with hate: … It behaves associated with delusion: … It behaves associated with conceit (pride): … It behaves associated with <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves associated with agitation: … It behaves associated with uncertainty: … It behaves associated with underlying-tendency: … It behaves dissociated from profitable actions: … It behaves associated with unprofitable actions: … It behaves associated with reprehensible actions: … It behaves dissociated from unreprehensible actions: … It behaves associated with dark actions: … It behaves dissociated from bright actions: … It behaves dissociated from pleasure-yielding actions: … It behaves associated with pain-yielding actions: … It behaves dissociated from actions resulting in pleasure: … It behaves associated with actions resulting in pain: … It behaves towards what is not known: this is a behaviour of unknowing. Such is the behaviour of unknowing: this is a behaviour of unknowing.</p>
<p>This is behaviour of unknowing.</p>
<p>393. What is behaviour of knowledge?</p>
<p>The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of contemplating impermanence is a behaviour of consciousness: the contemplation of impermanence is a behaviour of knowledge. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of contemplating pain … for the purpose of contemplating not self … for the purpose of contemplating dispassion … for the purpose of contemplating fading away … for the purpose of contemplating cessation … for the purpose of contemplating relinquishment … for the purpose of contemplating destruction … for <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en81' href='#pts-vp-en81'>PTS vp En 81</a> the purpose of contemplating fall … for the purpose of contemplating change … for the purpose of contemplating the signless … for the purpose of contemplating the desireless … for the purpose of contemplating voidness … for the purpose of insight into ideas which is the higher understanding … for the purpose of correct knowledge and insight … for the purpose of contemplating danger … for the purpose of contemplating reflexion is a behaviour of consciousness: the contemplation of reflexion is a behaviour of knowledge. The act of functional indeterminate adverting for the purpose of contemplating turning away is a behaviour of consciousness: the contemplation of turning away is a behaviour of knowledge. The stream-entry path is a behaviour of knowledge. The fruition of stream-entry … the once-return path … the fruition of once-return … the non-return path … the fruition of non-return … the arahant path is a behaviour of knowledge. The fruition of arahantship is a behaviour of knowledge.</p>
<p>394. Behaviour of knowledge: in what sense behaviour of knowledge?</p>
<p>It behaves without greed: this is a behaviour of knowledge. It behaves without hate: … It behaves without delusion: … It behaves without conceit (pride): … It behaves without <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves without agitation: … It behaves without uncertainty: … It behaves without underlying-tendency: … It behaves dissociated from greed: … It behaves dissociated from hate: … It behaves dissociated from delusion: … It behaves dissociated from conceit (pride): … It behaves dissociated from <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view: … It behaves dissociated from agitation: … It behaves dissociated from uncertainty: … It behaves dissociated from underlying-tendency: … It behaves associated with profitable actions: … It behaves dissociated from unprofitable actions: … It behaves dissociated from reprehensible actions: … It behaves associated with unreprehensible actions: … It behaves dissociated from dark actions: … It behaves associated with bright actions: … It behaves associated with pleasure-yielding actions: … It behaves dissociated from pain-yielding actions: … It behaves associated with actions resulting in pleasure: … It behaves dissociated from actions resulting in pain: … It behaves towards the known: this is a behaviour of knowledge. Such is the behaviour of knowledge: this is a behaviour of knowledge.</p>
<p>This is behaviour of knowledge.</p>
<p>395. The behaviour of consciousness is one, the behaviour of unknowing is another, the behaviour of knowledge is another.</p>
<p>Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of defining behaviour is knowledge of difference in behaviour”.</p>

<p>397. There are four planes: the sensual-desire sphere, the material sphere, the immaterial sphere, and the unincluded sphere.</p>
<p>398. What is the sensual-desire sphere plane?</p>
<p>Making the Avīci Hell the lower limit and making the Paranimmitavasavatti deities the upper limit, the aggregates, principles, bases, materiality, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, that are in this interval, have their sphere here, are included here: these are the sensual-desire sphere plane.</p>
<p>399. What is the material-sphere plane? Making the Brahmā World the lower limit and the Akaniṭṭha (Highest) deities the upper limit, the ideas of cognizance and consciousness-concomitants in one who has attained <span class='add'>[that plane by meditation]</span> or who has been reborn <span class='add'>[there]</span> or who <span class='add'>[as an arahant]</span> is abiding <span class='add'>[there]</span> in comfort here and now, which <span class='add'>[ideas]</span> have their sphere here, are included here: these are the material-sphere plane.</p>
<p>400. What is the immaterial-sphere plane? Making the deities of the base consisting of boundless space the lower limit and the deities of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception the upper limit, the ideas of cognizance and consciousness-concomitants in one who has attained or has been reborn or who is abiding in comfort here and now, which <span class='add'>[ideas]</span> have their sphere here, are included here: these are the immaterial-sphere plane.</p>
<p>401. What is the unincluded plane? The unincluded paths and fruitions of the paths and the unformed principle: these are the unincluded plane.</p>
<p>These are four planes.</p>
<p>402. Other four planes: four foundations of mindfulness, four right endeavours, four bases for success (roads to power), four jhanas, four measureless states, four immaterial-sphere attainments, four discriminations, four kinds of progress, four supporting objects, four Noble Ones' Heritages, four instances of help, four blessings, four steps in the True Idea.</p>

One who cognizes turns away, thus it is turning away of cognizance. One who uses knowledge turns away, thus it is turning away of knowledge. One who relinquishes turns away, thus it is turning away by liberation. He turns away in the meaning of suchness, thus it is turning away in the actualities.</p>
<p>Where there is turning away through perception, there there is turning away by the will: where there is turning away by the will, there there is turning away through perception.</p>
<p>Where there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will, there there is turning away of cognizance: where there is turning away of cognizance, there there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will.</p>
<p>Where there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away of cognizance, there there is turning away of knowledge: where there is turning away of knowledge, there there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away of cognizance.</p>
<p>Where there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away by cognizance and turning away of knowledge, there there is turning away by liberation: where there is turning away by liberation, there there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away of cognizance and turning away of knowledge.</p>
<p>Where <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en112' href='#pts-vp-en112'>PTS vp En 112</a> there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away of cognizance and turning away of knowledge and turning away by liberation, there there is turning away in the actualities: where there is turning away in the actualities, there there is turning away through perception and turning away by the will and turning away of cognizance and turning away of knowledge and turning away by liberation.</p>
<p>523. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of the meaning of suchness is knowledge of turning away in the actualities”.</p>
<h2>L. Supernormal Power (Success)</h2>
<p><i>524. How is it that understanding of the meaning of succeeding by defining body and cognizance as one and by steadying easy perception and quick perception is knowledge of the kinds of success (supernormal powers)?</i></p>
<p>525. Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to zeal and volitional-formation to endeavour. He develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to energy and volitional-formation to endeavour. He develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to cognizance and volitional-formation to endeavour. He develops the basis for success that possesses both concentration due to inquiry and volitional-formation to endeavour.</p>
<p>526. He completely develops and completely educates his cognizance in these four bases for success, and makes it malleable and wieldy.</p>
<p>527. Having completely developed and completely educated his cognizance in these four bases for success, and made it malleable and wieldy, he mounts his body upon his cognizance, and he mounts his cognizance upon his body, he converts his cognizance to accord with his body and he converts his body to accord with his cognizance, he steadies his cognizance to accord with his body and he steadies his body to accord with his cognizance.

<p>With his cognizance thus developed, purified and brightened, he directs, he inclines, his cognizance to the knowledge of success (supernormal power). He enjoys the various kinds of success (supernormal powers); having been one, he becomes many, having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains, as though in open space; he dives in and out of the earth as though in water, he goes on unbroken water as though on earth; seated cross-legged he travels in space like a winged bird; with his hands he touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and powerful; he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahmā World.</p>
<p>528. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of the meaning of succeeding by defining body and cognizance as one and by steadying easy perception and quick perception is knowledge of the kinds of success (supernormal powers)”.</p>

<p>536. He completely develops … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 526]</span> …</p>
<p>537. Having completely developed and completely educated his cognizance in these four bases for success, and made it malleable and wieldy, he understands <span class='add'>[the intervention of the three types of cognizance]</span> thus: “This materiality is originated by the joy faculty, this materiality is originated by the grief faculty, this materiality is originated by the equanimity faculty”.</p>
<p>With <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en115' href='#pts-vp-en115'>PTS vp En 115</a> his cognizance thus developed, purified and brightened, he directs, he inclines, his cognizance to the knowledge of penetration of wills (hearts). Penetrating with his heart the hearts of other beings, of other persons, he understands them thus: he understands greedy cognizance as greedy, ungreedy cognizance as ungreedy; he understands hating cognizance as hating, unhating cognizance as unhating; he understands deluded cognizance as deluded, undeluded cognizance as undeluded; he understands cramped cognizance as cramped, distracted cognizance as distracted; he understands exalted cognizance as exalted, he understands surpassed cognizance as surpassed, unsurpassed cognizance as unsurpassed; he understands concentrated cognizance as concentrated, unconcentrated cognizance as unconcentrated; he understands liberated cognizance as liberated, unliberated cognizance as unliberated <span class='add'>[D i 79]</span>.</p>

<h2>LIII. Recollection of Past Life</h2>
<p><i>539. How is it that understanding of fathoming ideas conditionally-arisen through intervention of difference and unity <span class='add'>[respectively]</span> in <span class='add'>[unprofitable and profitable]</span> action is knowledge of recollection of past life?</i></p>
<p>540. Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 525]</span>.</p>
<p>541. He completely develops … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 526]</span>.</p>
<p>542. Having completely developed and completely educated his cognizance in these four bases for success, and made it malleable and wieldy, he understands thus: “When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. That is to say: with ignorance as condition there are formations; with formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en116' href='#pts-vp-en116'>PTS vp En 116</a> as condition, mentality-materiality; with mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold base; with the sixfold base as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, being; with being as condition, birth; with birth as condition there are ageing and death, and sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair; thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering”.</p>
<p>With his cognizance thus developed, purified and brightened, he directs, he inclines, his cognizance to the knowledge of recollection of his past life; he recollects his manifold past life, that is to say: “One birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world contraction, many aeons of world expansion, many aeons of world contraction and expansion; there I was so named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and passing away from there, I appeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a race, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life span; and passing away from there, I appeared here”; thus with its aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past life <span class='add'>[D i 81]</span>.</p>
<p>543. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of fathoming ideas conditionally-arisen through intervention of difference and unity <span class='add'>[respectively]</span> in <span class='add'>[unprofitable and profitable]</span> action is knowledge of recollection of past life”.</p>
<h2>LIV. The Divine Eye</h2>
<p><i>544. How is it that understanding of the meaning of seeing signs of visible objects in their difference and unity by means of illumination is knowledge of the divine eye?</i></p>
<p>545. Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 525]</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en117' href='#pts-vp-en117'>PTS vp En 117</a>546. He completely develops … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 526]</span>.</p>
<p>547. Having completely developed and completely educated his cognizance in these four bases for success, and made it malleable and wieldy, he gives attention to the perception of light, he steadies the perception of day: “As the day is, so is the night; as the night is so is the day”. With his heart thus open and unenclosed he develops it accompanied by illumination.</p>
<p>548. With his cognizance thus developed, purified and brightened, he directs, he inclines, his cognizance to the knowledge of the passing away and realising of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and rearising, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destination; he understands beings as faring according to their actions: “These worthy beings, who are ill-conducted in body, speech and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in their views, acquirers of actions due to wrong views, have, on the break-up of the body, after death, rearisen in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell; but these worthy beings, who are well conducted in body, speech and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views, acquirers of actions due to right view, have, on the break-up of the body, after death, rearisen in a happy destination, in the heavenly world”; thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and rearising, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their destination; he understands beings as faring according to their actions <span class='add'>[D i 82]</span>.</p>
<p>549. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding of the meaning of seeing signs of visible objects in their difference and unity by means of illumination is knowledge of the divine eye”.</p>
<h2>LV. Exhaustion of Cankers</h2>
<p><i>550. How is it that understanding as mastery of three faculties in sixty-four aspects is knowledge of exhaustion of cankers?</i></p>
<p>551. Of what three faculties?</p>
<p>Of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en118' href='#pts-vp-en118'>PTS vp En 118</a> the I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown faculty, of the final-knowledge faculty, and of the final-knower faculty.</p>
<p>552. How many places does the I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown faculty go to? How many places does the final-knowledge faculty go to? How many places does the final-knower faculty go to?</p>
<p>The I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown faculty goes to one place, to the stream-entry path. The final-knowledge faculty goes to six places, to the fruition of stream entry, to the once-return path, to the fruition of once-return, to the non-return path, to the fruition of non-return, and to the arahant path. The final-knower faculty goes to one place, to the fruition of arahantship.</p>
<p>553. At the moment of the stream-entry path the <i>I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown faculty</i> is equipped with resolution by the faith faculty, equipped with exertion by the energy faculty, equipped with establishment by the mindfulness faculty, equipped with non-distraction by the concentration faculty, equipped with seeing by the understanding faculty, equipped with cognition by the mind faculty, equipped with delight by the joy faculty, equipped with the predominance of the occurring continuity by the life faculty.</p>
<p>At the moment of the stream-entry path all ideas born <span class='add'>[at that moment]</span>, except for cognizance originated materiality, are profitable, free from cankers, lead out, lead to dispersal, belong to the supramundane, have nibbana as their supporting-object.</p>
<p>At the moment of the stream-entry path the I-shall-come-to-know-the-unknown faculty has these eight faculties for its conascent equipment, for its mutual equipment, for its support equipment, for its associate equipment, they accompany each other, are conascent, are conjoined, are associated; they are its aspects and its equipment.</p>
<p>554. At the moment of the fruition of stream entry the <i>final-knowledge faculty</i> is equipped with resolution by the faith faculty, equipped with exertion by the energy faculty, equipped with establishment by the mindfulness faculty, equipped with non-distraction by the concentration faculty, equipped with seeing by the understanding faculty, equipped with cognition by the mind faculty, equipped with delight by the joy faculty, equipped with the predominance of the occurring continuity by the life faculty.</p>
<p>At the moment of the fruition of stream entry all ideas born <span class='add'>[at that moment]</span> are all indeterminate; except for cognizance-originated materiality, they all are free from cankers, belong to the supramundane, have nibbana as their supporting object.</p>
<p>At the moment of the fruition of stream entry the final-knowledge <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en119' href='#pts-vp-en119'>PTS vp En 119</a> faculty has these eight faculties for its conascent equipment, for its mutual equipment, for its support equipment, for its associate equipment, they accompany each other, are conascent, are conjoined, are associated; they are its aspects and equipment.</p>
<p>555. At the moment of the once-return path …</p>
<p>556. At the moment of the fruition of once-return …</p>
<p>557. At the moment of the non-return path …</p>
<p>558. At the moment of the fruition of once-return …</p>
<p>559. At the moment of the arahant path …</p>
<p>The final-knowledge faculty is equipped with resolution by the faith faculty … <span class='add'>[and so on as above]</span> … equipped with the predominance of the occurring continuity by the life faculty.</p>
<p>At the moment of the arahant path all ideas born <span class='add'>[at that moment]</span>, except for cognizance-originated materiality, are profitable, free from cankers, lead out, lead to dispersal, belong to the supramundane, have nibbana as their supporting object.</p>
<p>560. At the moment of the fruition of arahantship the <i>final-knower</i> faculty is equipped with resolution by the faith faculty, … <span class='add'>[and so on]</span> … equipped with the predominance of the continuity by the life faculty.</p>
<p>At the moment of fruition of arahantship all ideas born <span class='add'>[at that moment]</span> are indeterminate; except for cognizance originated materiality, they all are free from cankers, belong to the supramundane, have nibbana as their supporting object.</p>
<p>At the moment of fruition of arahantship the final-knower faculty has these eight faculties for its conascent equipment, for its mutual equipment, for its interdependent equipment, for its associate equipment, they accompany each other, are conascent, are conjoined, are associated; they are its aspects and its equipment.</p>
<p>So these eight octads amount to sixty-four (aspects).</p>
<p>561. <i>Cankers</i>: What are these cankers? They are the canker of sensual desires, the canker of being, the canker of views, the canker of ignorance.</p>
<p>562. Where are these cankers exhausted?</p>
<p>By the stream-entry path the canker of views is completely exhausted, the cankers of sensual-desires, being and ignorance, powerful enough to lead to states of deprivation are exhausted. These cankers are exhausted here.</p>
<p>By the once-return path the gross canker of sensual-desires is exhausted, and the cankers of being and ignorance coefficient with that are exhausted. These cankers are exhausted here.</p>
<p>By the non-return path the canker of sensual-desires is completely exhausted, and the cankers of being and ignorance coefficient with that are exhausted. These cankers are exhausted here.</p>
<p>By <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en120' href='#pts-vp-en120'>PTS vp En 120</a> the arahant path the canker of being and the canker of ignorance are completely exhausted. These cankers are exhausted here.</p>
<p>563. Knowledge is in the sense of that being known and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that. Hence it was said: “Understanding as mastery of three faculties in sixty-four aspects is knowledge of exhaustion of cankers”.</p>
<h2>LVI–LIX. The Actualities</h2>
<p><i>564. How is it that understanding of the meaning of full understanding is knowledge of suffering, that understanding of the meaning of abandoning is knowledge of origin, that understanding of the meaning of realizing is knowledge of cessation, that understanding of the meaning of developing is knowledge of the path?</i></p>
<p>565. Suffering has the meaning of oppressing, meaning of being formed, meaning of burning up, meaning of change, as its meaning of full understanding. Origin has the meaning of accumulating, meaning of source, meaning of bondage, meaning of impediment, as its meaning of abandoning. Cessation has the meaning of escape, meaning of seclusion, meaning of not being formed, meaning of deathlessness, as its meaning of realizing. The path has the meaning of outlet, meaning of cause, meaning of seeing, meaning of predominance, as its meaning of developing.</p>

<p>Any understanding, … right view, that arises contingent upon the origin of suffering: …</p>
<p>Any understanding, … right view, that arises contingent upon cessation of suffering: …</p>
<p>Any understanding, … right view, that arises contingent upon the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is called knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

Here the Perfect One (<i>tathāgata</i>) sees beings as with little dust on their eyes, as with much dust on their eyes, as with keen faculties, as with dull faculties, as of good parts, as of bad parts, as easy to instruct, as hard to instruct, and also some who see fear in the other world and in what is censurable, and also some who see no fear in the other world and in what is censurable.</p>
<p>575. <i>With little dust on their eyes, with much dust on their eyes:</i></p>
<p>A person with faith has little dust on his eyes; a person without faith has much dust on his eyes. An energetic person has little dust on his eyes; an idle person has much dust on his eyes. A person with established mindfulness has little dust on his eyes; a forgetful person has much dust on his eyes. A concentrated person has little dust on his eyes; an unconcentrated person has much dust on his eyes.

Or else, avoiding both these extremes, they either choose in conformity <span class='add'>[with supramundane knowledge]</span> with respect to ideas dependently arisen through specific conditionality or they acquire correct knowledge.</p>
<p>He also knows them as pursuing sensual-desires thus: “This person gives importance to sensual desires, is biassed towards sensual desires, is resolute upon sensual desires”. He also knows them as pursuing renunciation thus: “This person gives importance to renunciation, is biassed towards renunciation, is resolute upon renunciation”. He also knows them as pursuing ill-will thus: “This person gives importance to ill-will, is biassed towards ill-will, is resolute upon ill-will”. He also knows them as pursuing non-ill-will thus: “This person gives importance to non-ill-will, is biassed towards non-ill-will, is resolute upon non-ill-will”. He also knows them as pursuing stiffness-and-torpor thus: “This person gives importance to stiffness-and-torpor, is biassed towards stiffness-and-torpor, is resolute upon stiffness-and-torpor”. He also knows them as pursuing perception of light thus: “This person gives importance to perception of light, is biassed towards perception of light, is resolute upon perception of light”.</p>
<p>This is beings' bias.</p>
<p>587. What is beings' <i>underlying tendency?</i></p>
<p>There are seven underlying tendencies: Underlying tendency to greed for sensual-desire, underlying tendency to resistance, underlying tendency to conceit (pride), underlying tendency to <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view, underlying tendency to uncertainty, underlying tendency to greed for being, underlying tendency to ignorance.</p>
<p>Wherever in the world there is anything lovable and likable, there the underlying tendency to greed for sensual-desire underlies. Wherever in the world there is anything unlovable and unlikable, there the underlying tendency to resistance underlies. So upon these two ideas ignorance grows, and the conceit (pride), and <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view and uncertainty may be regarded as coefficient with that.</p>
<p>This is beings' underlying tendency.</p>
<p>588. What is <i>beings' behaviour?</i></p>
<p>Volitional-formation of merit, volitional-formation of demerit, and imperturbable volitional-formation—either with minor result or major result.</p>
<p>This is beings' behaviour.</p>
<p>589. What is <i>beings' resolution?</i></p>
<p>There are beings resolute upon what is inferior, and there are beings resolute upon what is superior. Beings resolute upon what is inferior <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en126' href='#pts-vp-en126'>PTS vp En 126</a> cultivate, frequent and welcome those resolute upon what is inferior. Beings resolute upon what is superior cultivate, frequent and welcome those resolute upon what is superior. Also in the past beings resolute upon what is inferior cultivated, frequented and welcomed those resolute upon what is inferior, and beings resolute upon what is superior cultivated, frequented and welcomed those resolute upon what is superior. Also in the future beings resolute upon what is inferior will cultivate, frequent and welcome those resolute upon what is inferior, and beings resolute upon what is superior will cultivate, frequent and welcome those resolute upon what is superior.</p>
<p>This is beings' resolution.</p>
<p>590. What are <i>incapable beings?</i></p>
<p>Any beings that are possessed of obstruction by action, possessed of obstruction by defilement, possessed of obstruction by action-result, without faith, without zeal, without understanding, and incapable of lighting upon the certainty of rightness in profitable ideas—these are incapable beings.</p>
<p>591. What are <i>capable beings?</i></p>
<p>Any beings that are not possessed of obstruction by action, not possessed of obstruction by defilement, not possessed of obstruction by action-result, have faith, have zeal, have understanding, and are capable of alighting upon the certainty of rightness in profitable ideas—these are capable beings.</p>
<p>This is the Perfect One's knowledge of beings' biasses and underlying tendencies.</p>

Amid the six colours of blue and yellow and red and white and pink and transparent the Blessed One walks while his created image stands or sits or lies down, the Blessed One stands while his created image walks or sits or lies down, the Blessed One sits while his created image walks or stands or lies down, the Blessed One lies down while his created image walks or stands or sits, the created image walks while the Blessed One stands or sits or lies down, the created image stands while the Blessed One walks or sits or lies down, the created image sits while the Blessed One walks or stands or lies down, the created image lies down while the Blessed One walks or stands or sits.</p>
