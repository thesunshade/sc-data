<h2>Section I</h2>
<p><i>2. How is it that misapprehension by misinterpretation is view?</i></p>
<p>Misapprehending by misinterpreting <i>materiality</i> thus “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” is view. Misapprehending by misinterpreting <i>feeling</i> thus “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” is view. Misapprehending by misinterpreting <i>perception</i> … [and so on
with 198 of the 201 ideas listed in Tr. I § 5, excluding the last three (supramundane) faculties, up to] …. Misapprehending by misinterpreting ageing-and-death thus “This is mine, this is I, this is my self” is view.</p>
<p>That is how misapprehension by misinterpretation is view.</p>
<h2>Section II</h2>
<p><i>3. What are the eight kinds of standpoints for views?</i></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en141' href='#pts-vp-en141'>PTS vp En 141</a>The aggregates are a standpoint for views, ignorance is a standpoint for views, contact …, perception …, applied-thought …, careless attention …, a bad friend …, indoctrination by another is a standpoint for views.
<p>4. The aggregates are a cause, the aggregates are a condition, in the sense of origination, for the arising of views, thus the aggregates are a standpoint for views. Ignorance … Contact … Perception … Applied-thought … Careless attention … A bad friend … Indoctrination by another is a cause, indoctrination by another is a condition, in the sense of origination, for the arising of views, thus indoctrination by another is a standpoint for views.</p>
<p>These are the eight kinds of standpoints for views.</p>
<h2>Section III</h2>
<p><i>5. What are the eighteen kinds of obsession by views?</i></p>
<p>Any view that is a recourse to views, thicket of views, wilderness of views, clash of views, travesty of views, fetter of views, dart of views, constraint of views, impediment of views, thong of views, pitfall of views, underlying-tendency to views, burning (torment) of views, fever (anguish) of views, knot of views, clinging of views, misinterpretation by views, misapprehension through views.</p>

<h3>(i)</h3>
<p><i>8. In what 35 aspects is there misinterpretation through (hedonistic) gratification views?</i></p>
<p>(1) “Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on materiality is the gratification in the case of materiality”, and any misapprehension and misinterpretation <span class='add'>[of that gratification]</span> is the view. The view is not the gratification, and the gratification is not the view; the view is one and the gratification is another; the view and the gratification <span class='add'>[together]</span> are called the (hedonistic) gratification view.</p>
<p>9. The (hedonistic) gratification view is a wrong view; wrong view is mistaken view. A person possessed of that mistaken view is mistaken in his view. A person mistaken in his view should not be cultivated, frequented, or honoured. Why not? Because his view contaminates.</p>
<p>10. Any greed for the view is not the view, and the view is not the greed; the view is one, and the greed another; the view and the greed <span class='add'>[together]</span> are called greed for views. A person possessed of that view and that greed is a person inflamed by <span class='add'>[greed for]</span> views. A gift given to a person inflamed by <span class='add'>[greed for]</span> views does not bear great fruit or great benefits. Why not? Because his view contaminates.</p>
<p>11. The (hedonistic) gratification view is a wrong view; a person with wrong view has two destinations, namely, hell or the animal generation. When a person has wrong view, his bodily actions and his verbal actions and his mental actions performed and completed according to that view, and any volition and aspiration and desire and action-formation of his are all ideas that lead to the unwanted, to the undesired, to the unwelcome, to harm, and to suffering. Why so? Because his view contaminates.</p>
<p>12. Just as when a nimba seed or a kosataki seed or a bitter-gourd seed is placed in damp soil and any solid humus or liquid humus taken up by it, all of it leads to bitterness, to sharpness, to unsatisfactoriness—<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en144' href='#pts-vp-en144'>PTS vp En 144</a>Why so? Because the seed contaminates—, so too, a person with wrong view has two destinations; … <span class='add'>[repeat as above]</span> … Why so? because his view contaminates.</p>
<p>13. The (hedonistic) gratification view is wrong view. Wrong view is a recourse to views, thicket of views, … <span class='add'>[repeat § 5]</span> … misapprehension by views.</p>
<p>14.–7. (2)–(5) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on feeling … <span class='add'>[and so on, repeating § 8 for each of the remaining four aggregates]</span>.</p>
<p>18.–23. (6)–(11) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on eye … <span class='add'>[and so on with each of the six internal bases]</span>.</p>
<p>24.–9. (12)–(17) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on visible objects … <span class='add'>[and so on with each of the six external bases]</span>.</p>
<p>30.–5. (18)–(23) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on eye consciousness … <span class='add'>[and so on with each of the six kinds of consciousness]</span>.</p>
<p>36.–41. (24)–(29) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on eye contact … <span class='add'>[and so on with each of the six kinds of contact]</span>.</p>
<p>42.–7. (30)–(35) Any pleasure and joy that arises dependent on eye-contact-born feeling … <span class='add'>[and so on with each of the six kinds of feeling up to]</span> …</p>
<p>The (hedonistic) gratification view is wrong view. Wrong view is a recourse to views, thicket of views, … <span class='add'>[repeat as at the end of § 9]</span> … misapprehension by views.</p>
<p>48. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind obsessed in these eighteen aspects <span class='add'>[beginning with the recourse to views]</span>. <span class='add'>[But]</span> there are fetters that are views as well, and there are fetters that are not views.</p>
<p>What fetters are views as well? <span class='add'>[Wrong]</span> views about individuality, and misapprehension of virtue and duty. These fetters are views as well.</p>
<p>What fetters are not views? The fetters of greed for sensual-desires, of resistance, of conceit (pride), of uncertainty, of greed for being, of envy, of avarice, of underlying tendency, and of ignorance … These fetters are not views.</p>
<p>There is misinterpretation through (hedonistic) gratification view in these 35 aspects.</p>
<h3>(ii)</h3>
<p><i>49. In what 20 aspects is there misinterpretation through views about self?</i></p>
<p>Here an untaught ordinary man who disregards the Noble Ones, is ignorant of the Noble Ones' True Idea, undisciplined in the Noble Ones' True Idea, who disregards Good Men, is ignorant of Good Men's True Idea, undisciplined in Good Men's True Idea,</p>
<p>(1) sees materiality as self, or (2) self possessed of materiality, or (3) <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en145' href='#pts-vp-en145'>PTS vp En 145</a> materiality in self, or (4) self in materiality; or (5) he sees feeling as self, or (6) self possessed of feeling, or (7) feeling in self, or (8) self in feeling; or (9) he sees perception as self, or (10) self possessed of perception, or (11) perception in self, or (12) self in perception; or (13) he sees formations as self, or (14) self possessed of formations, or (15) formations in self, or (16) self in formations; or (17) he sees consciousness as self, or (18) self possessed of consciousness, or (19) consciousness in self, or (20) self in consciousness.</p>
<p>50. (1) How does he see materiality as self? Here someone sees the earth kasina as self thus “What the earth kasina is, that I am; what I am, that the earth kasina is”, and he sees the earth kasina and self as identical. Just as one sees a lighted lamp's flame and colour as identical, thus “What the flame is, that the colour is; what the colour is, that the flame is”, so too, here someone sees … identical.</p>
<p>Misapprehension by misinterpretation is the view. The view is not the ground and the ground is not the view; the view is one, and the ground another. The view and the ground <span class='add'>[together]</span> are the first kind of view about self with materiality as ground.</p>
<p>51. Views about self are a wrong view; … <span class='add'>[repeat §§ 9–13]</span>.</p>
<p>52. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind … <span class='add'>[repeat § 48]</span>.</p>
<p>53.–5. Here someone sees the water kasina as self … <span class='add'>[as in §§ 50–2]</span>.</p>
<p>56.–8. Here someone sees the fire kasina as self …</p>
<p>59.–61. Here someone sees the air kasina as self …</p>
<p>62.–4. Here someone sees the blue kasina as self …</p>
<p>65.–7. Here someone sees the yellow kasina as self …</p>
<p>68.–70. Here someone sees the red kasina as self …</p>
<p>71.–3. Here someone sees the white kasina as self …</p>
<p>That is how he sees materiality as self.</p>
<p>74. (2) How does he see self possessed of materiality?</p>
<p>Here someone sees feeling, … perception, … formations, … consciousness as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this self of mine is possessed of materiality by means of this materiality” and thus sees self possessed of materiality. Just as, were there a tree possessed of shade, such that a man might say “This is the tree, this is the shade; the tree is one, the shade is another; but this tree is possessed of shade by means of this shade” and thus see the tree possessed of shade, so too, here someone sees … possessed of materiality.</p>
<p>Misapprehension by misinterpretation is view. The view is not the ground and the ground is not the view; the view is one, and the ground is another. The view and the ground <span class='add'>[together]</span> are the second kind of view about self with materiality as ground.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en146' href='#pts-vp-en146'>PTS vp En 146</a>75. Views about self are wrong view …</p>
<p>76. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind …</p>
<p>That is how he sees self possessed of materiality.</p>
<p>77. (3) How does he see materiality in self? Here someone sees feeling, … perception, … formations, … consciousness as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this materiality is in the self”, and thus sees materiality in self. Just as, were there a scented flower such that a man might say “This is the flower, this is the scent; the flower is one, and the scent another; but this scent is in this flower”, and thus see the scent in the flower, so too, here someone sees … materiality in self.</p>
<p>Misapprehension by misinterpretation is view. The view is not the ground, and the ground is not the view; the view is one, and the ground another. The view and the ground <span class='add'>[together]</span> are the third kind of view about self with materiality as ground.</p>
<p>78. Views about self are wrong view …</p>
<p>79. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind …</p>
<p>That is how he sees materiality in self.</p>
<p>80. (4) How does he see self in materiality? Here someone sees feeling, … perception, … formations, … consciousness as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this self of mine is in this materiality”, and thus he sees self in materiality. Just as, were there a gem placed in a casket such that a man might say “This is the gem, this is the casket; the gem is one, and the casket another; but this gem is in this casket”, and thus sees the gem in the casket, so too, here someone sees … self in materiality.</p>
<p>Misapprehension … The view and the ground <span class='add'>[together]</span> are the fourth kind of view about self with materiality as ground.</p>
<p>81. Views about self are wrong view …</p>
<p>82. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind …</p>
<p>That is how he sees self in materiality.</p>
<p>83. (5) How does he see feeling as self? Here someone sees eye-contact-born feeling, … ear-contact-born feeling, … nose-contact-born feeling, … tongue-contact-born feeling, … body-contact-born feeling, … mind-contact-born feeling as self thus “What mind-contact-born feeling is, that I am; what I am, that mind-contact-born feeling is”, and he sees the mind-contact-born feeling and self as identical. Just as … <span class='add'>[simile as in § 50]</span>, … so too, here someone sees … identical.</p>
<p>Misapprehension … <span class='add'>[as in § 50]</span> … The view and the ground <span class='add'>[together]</span> are the first kind of view about self with feeling as ground.</p>
<p>84. Views about self are wrong view …</p>
<p>85. <span class='add'>[Such wrong view is]</span> a bond for the mind …</p>
<p>That is how he sees feeling as self.</p>

Here someone sees perception … formations … consciousness … materiality as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this self of mine is possessed of feeling by means of this feeling”, and thus sees self possessed of feeling. Just as, … <span class='add'>[complete as in §§ 74–6 with same simile and appropriate adjustments]</span>.</p>
<p>That is how he sees self possessed of feeling.</p>
<p>89.–91. (7) How does he see feeling in self? Here someone sees … perception … formations … consciousness … materiality as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this feeling is in this self”, and thus sees feeling in self. Just as … <span class='add'>[simile as in § 77]</span>.</p>
<p>That is how he sees feeling in self.</p>
<p>92.–4. (8) How does he see self in feeling? Here someone sees perception … formations … consciousness … materiality as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this self of mine is in this feeling”, and thus sees self in feeling. Just as, … <span class='add'>[simile as in § 80]</span>.</p>

<p>98.–100. (10) How does he see self possessed of perception? Here someone sees formations … consciousness … materiality … feeling as self. He thinks “This is my self; but this self of mine is possessed of this perception by means of this perception”, and thus sees self possessed of perception. Just as …</p>
