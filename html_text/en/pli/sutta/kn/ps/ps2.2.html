<p>20. … in the sense of <i>actuality</i> …</p>
<p>21. … in the sense of <i>penetration</i> …</p>
<p>22. … in the sense of <i>directly knowing</i> …</p>
<p>23. … in the sense of <i>fully understanding</i> …</p>

<p>27. … in the sense of <i>realization</i> …</p>

<p>30. How many characteristics have the actualities? The actualities have two characteristics: the characteristic of the formed and the characteristic of the unformed. The actualities have these two characteristics.</p>
<p>31. How many characteristics have the actualities? The actualities have six characteristics: Of the formed actualities their arising is made known, their fall is made known, and their alteration when present is made known; of the unformed actuality no arising is made known, no fall is made known, and no alteration when present is made known. The actualities have these six characteristics.</p>
<p>32. How many characteristics have the actualities? The actualities have twelve characteristics: Of the actuality of suffering its arising is made known, its fall is made known, and its alteration when present is made known; of the actuality of origin its arising is made known, its fall is made known, and its alteration when present is made known; of the actuality of the path its arising is made known, its fall is made known, and its alteration when present is made known; of the actuality of cessation no arising is made known, no fall is made known, and no alteration when present is made known.

<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en301' href='#pts-vp-en301'>PTS vp En 301</a>33. Of the four actualities how many are profitable, how many are unprofitable, and how many are indeterminate? The actuality of origin is unprofitable, the actuality of the path is profitable, the actuality of cessation is indeterminate, and the actuality of suffering may be profitable or unprofitable or indeterminate.</p>
<p>34. <i>May be</i>: how may be? Since the actuality of suffering is unprofitable and the actuality of origin is unprofitable, thus in the sense of unprofitable, two actualities are included by one actuality and one actuality is included by two actualities. Since the actuality of suffering is profitable and the actuality of the path is profitable, thus in the sense of profitable two actualities are included by one actuality and one actuality is included by two actualities. Since the actuality of suffering is indeterminate and the actuality of cessation is indeterminate, thus in the sense of indeterminate two actualities are included by one actuality and one actuality is included by two actualities. Thus three actualities may be included by one actuality and one actuality may be included by three actualities, figuratively according to the instance <span class='add'>[given]</span>.</p>
<p>35. “Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I thought ‘In the case of materiality what is the attraction, what is the danger, what is the escape? In the case of feeling what is the attraction, what is the danger, what is the escape? In the case of perception, what is the attraction, what is the danger, what is the escape? In the case of formations what is the attraction, what is the danger, what is the escape? In the case of consciousness what is the attraction, what is the danger, what is the escape'?</p>
<p>“I thought ‘In the case of materiality it is the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on materiality that are the attraction; that materiality is impermanent, painful and subject to change is the danger; the removal of zeal and greed, the abandoning of zeal and greed, for materiality is the escape. In the case of feeling … In the case of perception … In the case of formations … In the case of consciousness it is the pleasure and joy that arise … the abandoning of zeal and greed, for consciousness is the escape’.</p>
<p>“So long as in the case of these five aggregates <span class='add'>[as objects]</span> of clinging I did not directly know the attraction as attraction and the danger as danger and the escape as escape correctly, so long did I not declare to have discovered the supreme full-enlightenment in the world with its deities, its Māras and its Brahmā Gods, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and men. But as soon as in the case of these five aggregates <span class='add'>[as objects]</span> of clinging I did directly know the attraction as <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en302' href='#pts-vp-en302'>PTS vp En 302</a> attraction and the danger as danger and the escape as escape correctly, then I declared to have discovered the supreme full-enlightenment in the world with its deities, its Māras and its Brahmā Gods, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and men. And the knowledge and the seeing was in me: ‘My will's deliverance is unassailable, this is the last birth, there is no renewal of being now’”.</p>
<p>36. The penetration by abandoning thus “In the case of materiality it is the pleasure and joy that arise dependent on materiality that are the attraction” is <span class='add'>[knowledge of]</span> the actuality of origin. The penetration by full understanding thus “In the case of materiality that materiality is impermanent, painful and subject to change is the danger” is <span class='add'>[knowledge of]</span> the actuality of suffering. The penetration by realization thus “In the case of materiality the removal of zeal and greed, the abandoning of zeal and greed, for materiality is the escape” is <span class='add'>[knowledge of]</span> the actuality of cessation. The penetration by development consisting in the view, thought, speaking, acting, living, effort, mindfulness, and concentration, in these three instances <span class='add'>[of origin, suffering and cessation]</span> is <span class='add'>[knowledge of]</span> the actuality of the path.</p>
<p>The penetration by abandoning thus “In the case of feeling …</p>
<p>… “In the case of perception …</p>
<p>… “In the case of formations …</p>
<p>… “In the case of consciousness … ”</p>
