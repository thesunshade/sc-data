<p>44. “There the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Friends’. ‘Friend' the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p>‘Friends, there are these seven enlightenment factors. What seven? They are the mindfulness enlightenment factor, … the equanimity enlightenment factor. These are the seven enlightenment factors.</p>
<p>‘Of these seven enlightenment factors, in whichever I wish to abide in the morning, in that I abide in the morning; in whichever I wish to abide at noon, in that I abide at noon; in whichever I wish to abide in the evening, in that I abide in the evening.</p>
<p>‘If <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en314' href='#pts-vp-en314'>PTS vp En 314</a> it occurs to me that there is the mindfulness enlightenment factor, it occurs to me that it is measureless, and it occurs to me that it is well undertaken; and while it is remaining I know that it remains; and if it falls away in me, I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality. If it occurs to me that there is the investigation-of-ideas enlightenment factor … the equanimity enlightenment factor, it occurs to me that it is measureless, and it occurs to me that it is well undertaken; and while it is remaining I know that it remains; and if it falls away in me, I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality.</p>
<p>‘Suppose a king or a king's minister had a chest full of cloths of many colours, then whichever pair of cloths he wished to put on in the morning, that he would put on in the morning; whichever pair of cloths he wished to put on at noon, that he would put on at noon; whichever pair of cloths he wished to put on in the evening, that he would put on in the evening: so too, of these seven enlightenment factors, in whichever I wish to abide in the morning, in that I abide in the morning; … I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality’,”.</p>
<p>45. How is there an enlightenment factor thus: “<i>If it occurs to me that there is the mindfulness enlightenment factor</i>”?</p>
<p>As long as cessation is established, so long is there an enlightenment factor thus: “If it occurs to me that there is the mindfulness enlightenment factor”. Just as when an oil lamp is burning, as long as there is a flame, so long is there light, and as long as there is light, so long is there a flame: so too, as long as cessation is established, so long is there an enlightenment factor thus: “If it occurs to me that there is the mindfulness enlightenment factor”.</p>
<p>46. How is there an enlightenment factor thus: “<i>It occurs to me that it is measureless</i>”?</p>
<p>Defilements are bound up with <span class='add'>[the limitation of]</span> measure, and so are all obsessions, and those formations that produce renewed being; cessation is measureless in the sense that it is immobile and in the sense that it is unformed. As long as cessation is established, so long is there an enlightenment factor thus: “It occurs to me that it is measureless”.</p>
<p>47. How is there an enlightenment factor thus: “<i>It occurs to me that it is well undertaken</i> (brought to very sameness)”?</p>
<p>Defilements are unsame and so are the obsessions, and those formations that produce renewed being; cessation is an idea of sameness in the sense that it is peaceful and in the sense that it is sublime. As long as cessation is established, so long is there an enlightenment factor thus: “It occurs to me that it is well undertaken (brought to very sameness)”.</p>
<p>48. How is it that “<i>While it is remaining</i> <i>I know that it remains; and</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en315' href='#pts-vp-en315'>PTS vp En 315</a> <i>if it falls away in me, I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality</i>”?</p>
<p>In how many aspects does the mindfulness enlightenment factor remain? In how many aspects does the mindfulness enlightenment factor fall away?</p>
<p>The mindfulness enlightenment factor remains in eight aspects; the mindfulness enlightenment factor falls away in eight aspects.</p>
<p>49. In what eight aspects does the mindfulness enlightenment factor remain?</p>
<p>The mindfulness enlightenment factor remains by non-arising being adverted to; the mindfulness enlightenment factor remains by arising not being adverted to … by non-occurrence being adverted to … by occurrence not being adverted to … by the signless being adverted to … by the sign not being adverted to … by cessation being adverted to; the mindfulness enlightenment factor remains by formations not being adverted to.</p>
<p>The mindfulness enlightenment factor remains in these eight aspects.</p>
<p>50. In what eight aspects does the mindfulness enlightenment factor fall away?</p>
<p>The mindfulness enlightenment factor falls away by arising being adverted to. The mindfulness enlightenment factor falls away by non-arising not being adverted to … by occurrence being adverted to … by non-occurrence not being adverted to … by the sign being adverted to … by the signless not being adverted to … by formations being adverted to. The mindfulness enlightenment factor falls away by cessation not being adverted to.</p>
<p>The mindfulness enlightenment factor falls away in these eight aspects.</p>
<p>That is how it is that “While it is remaining I know that it remains; and if it falls away in me, I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality”.</p>
<p>51.–56. … the investigation-of-ideas enlightenment factor …</p>
<p>57.–62. … the energy enlightenment factor …</p>
<p>63.–68. … the happiness enlightenment factor …</p>
<p>69.–74. … the tranquillity enlightenment factor …</p>
<p>75.–80. … the concentration enlightenment factor …</p>
<p>81.–86. How is there an enlightenment factor thus: “<i>If it occurs to me that there is the equanimity enlightenment factor</i>”?</p>
<p>As long as …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The equanimity enlightenment factor falls away in these eight aspects.</p>
<p>That is how it is that “While it is remaining I know that it remains; <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en316' href='#pts-vp-en316'>PTS vp En 316</a> and if it falls away in me, I know that it falls away in me owing to specific conditionality”.</p>
