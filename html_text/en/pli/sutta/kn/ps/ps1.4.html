At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus’. ‘Venerable sir’ they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p>2. ‘Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The faith faculty, the energy faculty, the mindfulness faculty, the concentration faculty, the understanding faculty. These are the five faculties, bhikkhus’”.</p>
<p>3. In how many aspects are these five faculties purified?</p>

<p>When he avoids faithless persons, cultivates and frequents and honours faithful persons, and reviews Suttas that inspire confidence, the faith faculty is purified in him in these three aspects.</p>
<p>When he avoids idle persons, cultivates and frequents and honours energetic persons, and reviews the right endeavours, the energy faculty is purified in him in these three aspects.</p>
<p>When he avoids forgetful persons, cultivates, frequents and honours mindful persons, and reviews the foundations of mindfulness, the mindfulness faculty is purified in him in these three aspects.</p>
<p>When he avoids unconcentrated persons, cultivates, frequents and honours concentrated persons, and reviews the jhanas and liberations, the concentration faculty is purified in him in these three aspects.</p>
<p>When he avoids persons with no understanding, cultivates, frequents and honours persons possessed of understanding, and reviews the behaviour of profound knowledge, the understanding faculty is purified in him in these three aspects.</p>
<p>So when he avoids these five kinds of persons, cultivates, frequents and honours these five kinds of persons, and reviews these five sorts of Suttas, these five faculties are purified in him in these fifteen aspects.</p>

<p>When he is abandoning agitation he is developing the concentration faculty; when he is developing the concentration faculty he is abandoning agitation.</p>
<p>When he is abandoning ignorance he is developing the understanding faculty; when he is developing the understanding faculty he is abandoning ignorance.</p>
<p>The five faculties are being developed in these ten aspects. There is development of the five faculties in these ten aspects.</p>
<p>5. In how many aspects have the five faculties been developed, quite developed?</p>
<p>The five faculties have been developed, quite developed, in ten aspects. Because non-faith has been abandoned, quite abandoned, the faith faculty has been developed, quite developed; because the faith faculty has been developed, quite developed, non-faith has been abandoned, quite abandoned.</p>
<p>Because idleness …</p>
<p>Because negligence …</p>
<p>Because agitation …</p>
<p>Because ignorance has been abandoned, quite abandoned, the understanding faculty has been developed, quite developed; because the understanding faculty has been developed, quite developed, ignorance has been abandoned, quite abandoned.</p>

<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of dominance.</p>
<p>88. How are the faculties to be found in the sense of purifying the beginning?</p>
<p>The faith faculty is in the sense of resolution; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of non-faith is purifying of the beginning of the faith faculty. The energy faculty is in the sense of exerting; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of idleness is the purifying of the beginning of the energy faculty. The mindfulness faculty is in the sense of establishing; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of negligence is the purifying of the beginning of the mindfulness faculty. The concentration faculty is in the sense of non-distraction; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of agitation is the purifying of the beginning of the concentration faculty. The understanding faculty is in the sense of seeing; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of ignorance is the purifying of the beginning of the understanding faculty.</p>

In non-ill-will there are the five faculties; purification of virtue in the sense of restraint of ill-will is the purifying of the beginning of the five faculties. In perception of light … <span class='add'>[and so on in the case of each of the rest of the five hindrances, four jhanas, four immaterial attainments, eighteen Principal Insights, and four paths, up to]</span> … In the arahant path there are the five faculties; purification of virtue in <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en228' href='#pts-vp-en228'>PTS vp En 228</a> the sense of restraint of all defilements is the purifying of the beginning of the five faculties.</p>
<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of purification of the beginning.</p>
<p>90. How are the faculties to be found in the sense of outstandingness?</p>
<p>With the development of the faith faculty zeal arises, with the abandoning of non-faith zeal arises, with the abandoning of anguish of non-faith zeal arises, with the abandoning of defilements coefficient with <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view zeal arises, with the abandoning of gross defilements zeal arises, with the abandoning of secondary defilements zeal arises, with the abandoning of all defilements zeal arises; through zeal gladness arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to gladness. Through gladness happiness arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to happiness. Through happiness tranquillity arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to tranquillity. Through tranquillity pleasure arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to pleasure. Through pleasure illumination arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to illumination. Through illumination a sense of urgency arises; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to a sense of urgency. With a sense of urgency he concentrates cognizance; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to concentration. He thoroughly exerts cognizance thus concentrated; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to exertion. He looks on with complete equanimity at cognizance thus exerted; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to equanimity. Owing to equanimity cognizance is liberated from the many sorts of defilements; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to liberation. Because of its being liberated those ideas come to have a single function (taste); then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to development in the sense of single function (taste). Because of its being developed it therefore turns away to what is superior <span class='add'>[namely, to nibbana]</span>; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to turning away. Because of its having turned away he <span class='add'>[namely, the person now possessed of the path,]</span> therefore relinquishes <span class='add'>[both defilements and aggregates]</span>; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to relinquishment. Because of their having been relinquished those <span class='add'>[defilements and aggregates]</span> therefore cease <span class='add'>[without rearising]</span>; then the faith faculty is outstanding as faith due to cessation.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of relinquishment through cessation: relinquishment as giving up and relinquishment as entering into (launching out into). It gives up defilements and aggregates, thus it is relinquishment as giving up; cognizance enters into (launches out into) cessation which is the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en229' href='#pts-vp-en229'>PTS vp En 229</a> nibbana principle, thus it is relinquishment as entering into (launching out into). These are the two kinds of relinquishment through cessation.</p>
<p>91. With the development of the energy faculty zeal arises, with the abandoning of idleness zeal arises, with the abandoning of anguish of idleness zeal arises, with the abandoning of defilements coefficient with <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> view zeal arises, … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 90 up to the end, substituting <i>energy</i> for <i>faith</i>]</span>.</p>
<p>92. With the development of the mindfulness faculty zeal arises, with the abandoning of negligence zeal arises, …</p>
<p>93. With the development of the concentration faculty zeal arises, with the abandoning of agitation zeal arises, …</p>
<p>94. With the development of the understanding faculty zeal arises, with the abandoning of ignorance zeal arises, … These are the two kinds of relinquishment through cessation.</p>
<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of outstandingness.</p>
<p class='end'>End of Second Recitation Section</p>
<p>95.–9. How are the faculties to be found in the sense of steadying?</p>
<p>With the development of the faith faculty zeal arises; then the faith faculty is steady as faith due to zeal. Through zeal gladness arises; then the faith faculty is steady as faith due to gladness …</p>
<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of steadying.</p>
<p>100. How are the faculties to be found in the sense of terminating?</p>
<p>In the sense of resolution the faith faculty terminates non-faith, terminates anguish of non-faith. In the sense of exertion the energy faculty terminates idleness, terminates anguish of idleness. In the sense of establishing the mindfulness faculty terminates negligence, terminates anguish of negligence. In the sense of non-distraction the concentration faculty terminates agitation, terminates anguish of agitation. In the sense of seeing the understanding faculty terminates ignorance, terminates anguish of ignorance.</p>
<p>101. In renunciation the five faculties terminate zeal for sensual-desire. In non-ill-will the five faculties terminate ill-will … <span class='add'>[and so on with the rest of the seven hindrances, etc., up to]</span> … In the arahant path the five faculties terminate all defilements.</p>
<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of terminating.</p>
<p>102. How are the five faculties to be found in the sense of founding upon?</p>
<p>One who has faith founds the faith faculty upon resolution, the faith faculty in one who has faith is founded upon resolution. One who has <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en230' href='#pts-vp-en230'>PTS vp En 230</a> energy founds energy upon exertion; the energy faculty in one who has energy is founded upon exertion. One who has mindfulness founds the mindfulness faculty upon establishment; the mindfulness faculty in one who has mindfulness is founded upon establishment. One who has concentration founds the concentration faculty upon non-distraction; the concentration faculty in one who has concentration is founded upon non-distraction. One who has understanding founds the understanding faculty upon seeing; the understanding faculty in one who has understanding is founded upon seeing.</p>
<p>103. A meditator founds the five faculties upon renunciation; the five faculties in a meditator are founded upon renunciation. A meditator founds the five faculties upon non-ill-will; the five faculties in a meditator are founded upon non-ill-will … <span class='add'>[and so on up to]</span> … A meditator founds the five faculties upon the arahant path; the five faculties in a meditator are founded upon the arahant path.</p>
<p>This is how the faculties are to be found in the sense of founding upon.</p>
